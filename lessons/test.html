        <br><br>
        The plasma membrane is the edge of life, the boundary that separates the living cell from its surroundings and controls traffic into and out of the cell it surrounds. Like all biological membranes, the plasma membrane exhibits selective permeability; that is, it allows some substances to cross it more easily than others. The ability of the cell to discriminate in its chemical exchanges with its environment is fundamental to life, and it is the plasma membrane and its component molecules that make this selectivity possible.
        <br><br>
        The cell membrane possesses some effectively. These properties include (1) fluidity, (2) semi-permeability, and (3) rigidity. Fluidity and rigidity play their function for keeping the cell membrane intact, thus protecting the organelles inside while keeping out potential toxic materials. Being semi-permeable allows the cell membrane to study.com selectively allow entry and exit of materials through. Therefore, the two main function of the cell membrane are: (1) for protection and (2) for transport of materials in and out of the cell. Also, because of phospholipid bilayer's amphipathic molecular structure (hydrophobic tail and hydrophilic head), the cell membrane is stable.
        <br><br>
        Transport of molecules in and out of the cell is affected by the concentration gradient and the type of molecules that is to be transported. There are molecules that can easily enter and exit the cell membrane without the use of energy (passive), whereas there are those that ultimately requires the use of energy (ATP) to proceed. Concentration gradient easily affects the process, molecules move passively from regions with higher concentration, while they move actively (uses energy in the form of ATP) when moving from regions with low concentration towards a region with higher concentration
        <h2>LESSON 12:TRANSPORT MECHANISM IN CELL</h2>

        There are two major ways in which molecule or particies can move across a membrane. It is either by passive or active transport.
        <br><br>
        Passive Transport This process does not require energy for molecules to pass through the plasma membrane. Molecules move down their concentration gradient. A gradient is any imbalance in the concentration. Passive transport moves molecules from higher concentration to lower concentration. This process is carried out to maintain an equilibrium level in a cell. Passive transport moves molecules by Simple Diffusion, and Facilitated Diffusion or Osmosis.
        <br><br>
        Simple Diffusion allows non polar molecules such as oxygen (02) and carbon dioxide (CO2) to pass directly on the membrane. Facilitated Diffusion does not require energy but needs a membrane transport channel or carrier protein to transport ions such as sodium (Na+) and potassium (K+).
        <br><br>
        Osmosis is a special type of diffusion specifically associated with the movement of water molecules. A solution with higher concentration of solutes is said to be hypertonic while a solution with a lower concentration of solutes is hypotonic. Water crosses the membrane until the solute concentrations are equal on both sides. Solutions of equal solution concentration are said to be isotonic.
        <br><br>
        Active Transport is the movement of molecules from region of low concentration to high concentration. It occurs against a concentration gradient that is why it requires energy released from ATP (Adenosine triphosphate) for molecules. to pass through the cell membrane. Complex sugar, ions, large cells, proteins, and other particles are transported in this process. There are two categories: primary active transport and secondary active transport. Primary active transport uses energy usually through ATP hydrolysis. Secondary active transport relies on primary active transport, it requires energy and moves against a concentration gradients.
        <br><br>
        Exocytosis, endocytosis and sodium-potassium pump are a few examples of active transport. Large molecules enter the cell by generalized non-selective process known as endocytosis. Phagocytosis is endocytosis of a particulate material while pinocytosis is endocytosis of liquid material. In this process, the plasma membrane engulfs the particle or fluid droplet and pinches off a membranous sac or vesicles with a particular fluid inside into the cytoplasm. Exocytosis is the reverse process where a membrane bound vesicle filled with bulky materials moves to the plasma membrane and fuses with it. In this process, the vesicles contents are released out of the cell.
        
        <h2>LESSON 13:EXOCYTOSIS AND ENDOCYTOSIS</h2>

        In addition to moving small ions and molecules through the membrane, cells also need to remove and take in larger molecules and particles. Some cells are even capable engulfing entire of unicellular microorganisms. You might have correctly hypothesized that the uptake and release of large particles by the cell requires energy. A large particle, however, cannot pass through the membrane, even with energy supplied by the cell. Some molecules or particles are just too large to pass through the plasma membrane or to move through a transport protein. So cells use two other active transport processes to move these macromolecules (large molecules) into or out of the cell. Vesicles or other bodies in the cytoplasm move macromolecules or large particles across the plasma membrane.
        <br><br>
        There are two types of vesicle transport, endocytosis and exocytosis (illustrated in the Figure below). Both processes are active transport processes, requiring energy.
        <br><br>
        Endocytosis' was given by Christain de Duve in the year 1963. Both the terms refers to the intake of material through the plasma membrane by forming vesicles which are a membrane-bound droplet located inside the cytoplasm of the cell. Endocytosis occurs in the animal cell and very rarely
        in plant cell as the plant cell is surrounded by the cell wall, which causes hindrance in the invagination of the plasma membrane.
        <br><br>

        <br><br>
        Endocytosis is a type of active transport that moves particles, such as large molecules, parts of cells, and even whole cells, into a cell. There are different variations of endocytosis, but all share a common characteristic: the plasma membrane of the cell invaginates, forming a pocket around the target particle. The pocket pinches off, resulting in the particle being contained in a newly created intracellular vesicle formed from the plasma. membrane.
        <br><br>
        THREE TYPES OF ENDOCYTOSIS
        <br><br>
        1. PHAGOCYTOSIS
        <br><br>
        Phagocytosis (the condition of "cell eating") is the process by which large particles, such as cells or relatively large particles, are taken in by a cell. For example, when microorganisms invade the human body, a type of white blood cell called a neutrophil will remove the invaders through this process, surrounding and engulfing the microorganism, which is then destroyed by the neutrophil (see figure 1 below).
        <br><br>
        2. PINOCYTOSIS
        <br><br>
        This literally means "cell drinking". It is the intake of liquid and small particles usually, ions, amino acids, sugars, insulin, and lipoproteins. It was named at a time when the assumption was that the cell was purposefully taking in extracellular fluid. In reality, this is a process that takes in molecules, including water, which the cell needs from the extracellular fluid. Pinocytosis results in a much smaller vesicle than phagocytosis, and the vesicle does not need to merge with a lysosome (see Figure 2 below).
        <br><br>
        The vacuoles or vesicles formed in caveolae (singular caveola) are smaller than those in pinocytosis. Potocytosis is used to bring small molecules into the cell and to transport these molecules through the cell for their release on the other side of the cell, a process called transcytosis.
        <br><br>
        3. RECEPTOR-MEDIATED ENDOCYTOSIS
        <br><br>
        A targeted variation of endocytosis employs receptor proteins in the plasma membrane that have a specific binding affinity for certain substances (Figure 3 below).
        <br><br>
        In receptor-mediated endocytosis, as in phagocytosis, clathrin is attached to the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane. If uptake of a compound is dependent on receptor-mediated endocytosis and the process is Ineffective, the material will not be removed from the tissue fluids or blood. Instead, it will stay in those fluids and increase in concentration.
        <br><br>
        Some human diseases are caused by the failure of receptor-mediated endocytosis. For example, the form of cholesterol termed low-density lipoprotein or LDL (also referred to as "bad" cholesterol) is removed from the blood by receptor-mediated endocytosis. In the human genetic disease familial hypercholesterolemia, the LDL receptors are defective or missing entirely. People with this condition have life-threatening levels of cholesterol in their blood, because their cells cannot clear LDL particles from their blood.
        <br><br>
        Although receptor-mediated endocytosis is designed to bring specific substances that are normally found in the extracellular fluid into the cell, other substances may gain entry into the cell at the same site. Flu viruses, diphtheria, and cholera toxin all have sites that cross-react with normal receptor-binding sites and gain entry into cells.
        <br><br>
        EXOCYTOSIS is the reverse process of moving material into a cell is the process of exocytosis. Exocytosis is the opposite of the processes discussed in the last section in that its purpose is to expel material from the cell into the extracellular fluid. Waste material is enveloped in a membrane and fuses with the interior of the plasma membrane. This fusion opens the membranous envelope on the exterior of the cell, and the waste material is expelled into the extracellular space (see Figure 4 below).
