        <h2>LESSON 1:CELL THEORY</h2>

        <h3 class="color">The Theory of Spontenous Generation</h3>
        
        The Greek philosopher <strong>Aristotle</strong>(384-322 BC) was onr of the earliest recorded scholars to articulate the theory of spontaneous generation, the <strong>notion that life can arise from nonliving matter</strong>. Aristotle proposed that life arose from nonliving material if the material contained pneuma("vital heat"). As evidence, he noted several instances of the appearance of animals from environments previously devoid of such animals such as the seemingly sudden appearance of fish in a new puddle of water.
        <br><br>
        This theory persisted into the seventeenth century, when scientists undertook additional experimentation to support or disprove it. By this time, the proponents of the theory cited how frogs simply seem to appear along the muddy banks of the Nile River in Egypt during the annual flooding. Others observed that mice simply appeared among grain stored in barns with thatched roofs. When the roof leaked and the grain molded, mice appeared. <strong>Jan Baptista van Helmont</strong>, a seventeenth century Flemish scientist, proposed that mice could arise from rags and wheat kernels left in an open container for 3 weeks. In reality, such habitats provided ideal food sources and shelter for mouse populations to flourish.
        <br><br>
        However, one of van Helmont's contemporaries, Italian physician <strong>Francesco Redi (1626-1697)</strong>, performed an experiment in 1668 that was one of the first to refute the idea that maggots (the larvae of flies) spontancously generate on meat left out in the open air. He predicted that preventing flies from having direct contact with the meat would also prevent the appearance of maggots. Redi left meat in each of six containers (Figure1). Two were open to the air, two were covered with gauze, and two were tightly sealed. His hypothesis was supported when maggots developed in the uncovered jars, but no maggots appeared in either the gauze-covered or the tightly sealed jars. He concluded that maggots could only form when flies were allowed to lay eggs in the meat, and that the maggots were the offspring of flies, not the product of spontaneous generation.
        In 1745, <strong>John Needham</strong> (1713-1781) published a report of his own experiments, in which he briefly boiled broth infused with plant or animal matter, hoping to kill all preexisting microbes. He then scaled the flasks. After a few days, Needham observed that the broth had become cloudy and a single drop contained numerous microscopic creatures. He argued that the new microbes must have arisen spontaneously. In reality, however, he likely did not boil the broth enough to kill all preexisting microbes.
        <strong>Lazzaro Spallanzani</strong> (1729-1799) did not agree with Needham's conclusions, however, and performed hundreds of carefully executed experiments using heated broth. As in Neetham's experiment, broth in scaled jars and unscaled jars was infused with plant and animal matter. Spallanzani's results contradicted the findings of Needham: Heated but sealed flasks remained clear, without any signs of spontaneous growth, unless the flasks were subsequently opened to the air. This suggested that microbes were introduced into these flasks from the air. In response to Spallanzani's findings, Needham argued that life originates from a "life force" that was destroyed during Spallanzani's extended boiling. Any subsequent sealing of the flasks then prevented new life force from entering and causing spontaneous generation (Figure 2).
        The debate over spontaneous generation continued well into the nineteenth century, with scientists serving as proponents of both sides. To settle the debate, the Paris Academy of Sciences offered a prize for resolution of the problem. Louis Pasteur, a prominent French chemist who had been studying microbial fermentation and the causes of wine spoilage, accepted the challenge. In 1858, Pasteur filtered air through a gun-cotton filter and, upon microscopic examination of the cotton, found it full of microorganisms, suggesting that the exposure of a broth to air was not introducing a "life force" to the broth but rather airborne microorganisms.
        Later, Pasteur made a series of flasks with long, twisted necks ("swan-neck flasks), in which he boiled broth to sterilize it (Figure 3). His design allowed air inside the flasks to be exchanged with air from the outside, but prevented the introduction of any airborne microorganisms, which would get caught in the twists and bends of the flasks' necks. If a life force besides the airborne microorganisms were responsible for microbial growth within the sterilized flasks, it would have access to the broth, whereas the microorganisms would not. He correctly predicted that sterilized broth in his swan-neck flasks would remain sterile as long as the swan necks remained intact. However, should the necks be broken, microorganisms would be introduced, contaminating the flasks and allowing microbial growth within the broth.
        Pasteur's set of experiments irrefutably disproved the theory of spontaneous generation and earned him the prestigious Alhumbert Prize from the Paris Academy of Sciences in 1862. In a subsequent lecture in 1864, Pasteur articulated "Omne vivum ex vivo" ("Life only comes from life"). In this lecture, Pasteur recounted his famous swan-neck flask experiment, stating that "life is a germ and a germ is life. Never will the doctrine of spontaneous generation recover from the mortal blow of this simple experiment.

        <strong>Little is much: Understanding the Cork</strong>
        <br><br>
        The discovery of cells was made possible by the development of the microscope in the 17th century. In 1665, an English scientist,<strong>Robert Hooke</strong>, examined a thin slice of cork under the microscope. He observed that the piece of cork was composed of many tiny compartments which resembled little rooms with surrounding wall. Hooke named these compartments cells. The cells that Hooke observed were not living. He concentrated his study only on the structure, particularly on the cell investigation of the cell content.
        In 1674, the Dutch inventor <strong>Antoine Van Leuwenhoek</strong> observed red blood cells, sperms and a myriad of single-celled organisms in pond water. He discovered free cells and observed the nucleus within some red blood cells. Leuwenhock was a contemporary of Robert Hooke. He had more success in living cells in action despite his smaller, simpler, handled microscopes.
        Over the next 200 years after Hooke, another scientist, a Scottish botanist named <strong>Robert Brown</strong>, made a general conclusion in 1831. He discovered the nucleus and theorized that this structure is a fundamental and a constant component of the cell.
        In 1835, a French biologist,<strong>Felix Dujardin</strong> found out that living cells contained an internal substance, Not knowing exactly what this substance was, Dujardin gave it the name sarcode. It was a Bohemian physiologist, Jan Evangelista Purkinje, who made a thorough investigation of this internal material. He gave it the name protoplasm, a term coined for the colloidal substance in the cell which is currently known as cytoplasm.
        In 1838, <strong>Mathias Schleiden</strong>, a German botanist, stated that all plants are composed of cells. After him, in 1839, <strong>Theodore Schwann</strong>, a German zoologist, concluded that all animals are composed of cells. Jointly, Schleiden and Schwann came out with the theory that all living things are composed of cells. Twenty years later, in 1858, a German biologist, <strong>Rudolph Virchow</strong>, theorized that all living cells. come from pre-existing living cells. His conclusion arose from observing dividing cells while he was at work.
        
        <h2>LESSON 2:CELL STRUCTURE AND FUNCTIONS</h2>

        Roles to Rules; Structure to function
        <br><br>
        All of the life processes of a living cell involve transformation of energy and matter. The source of this life energy is the molecules undergoing chemical activities within the cell. A living cell performs the following life processes:
        <br><br>
        1. Nutrition is the process by which cells obtain food molecules to support their other activities.
        <br><br>
        2. Digestion is the process by which food particles are broken down into smaller soluble units suitable for cell use with the help of enzymes.
        <br><br>
        3. Absorption is the process by which cells absorb water, minerals and other materials essential to life from their environment,
        <br><br>
        4. Biosynthesis is the process by which all cells organize complex chemicals from simple building units or substances.
        <br><br>
        5. Excretion is the process by which by-products of all cell activities which are not needed for further cell functioning are eliminated.
        <br><br>
        6. Egestion is the process by which insoluble, non-digested particles. are eliminated by the cell.
        <br><br>
        7. Secretion is the process by which substances that are synthesized by the cells are expelled from the membrane. This elimination process helps in the functioning of the body,
        <br><br>
        8. Movement is a process which includes the locomotion of cell by means of special structures like cilia or flagella.
        <br><br>
        9. Irritability is the process by which cells respond or react to external factors or conditions around them. Cells can alter their functions in response to changes their environment.
        <br><br>
        10. Respiration is the process of breaking down food molecules into
        chemical energy needed by all cells in order to function. 11. Reproduction is a process by which a cell copies or replicates its DNA and increases its number by cell division. It gives rise to new cells as a result, organisms grow.
        <br><br>
        The principal parts of a cell are:
        <br><br>
        1. Cell membrane
        <br><br>
        2. Cytoplasm
        <br><br>
        3. Nucleus
        <br><br>
        The nucleus is covered with a membrane that allows materials to pass in and out. It's often called the "control center" of the cell because it contains DNA. The nucleolus is where the ribosomes are formed and this structure can be found both in plants. and animals.
        <br><br>
        The cell membrane is a semi-permeable membrane that facilitate the movement of molecules inside and outside the plant or animal cell. It allows only chosen substances to enter or leave cell which can protect the cell from harmful substances.
        <br><br>
        The cell membrane is often pictured as fluid mosaic model. Fluidity becomes its characteristic because its molecules are constantly moving The phospholipid molecules move sideways within the membrane. Since the plasma membrane is fluid, it can seal itself if it is damaged or broken.
        <br><br>
        The cytoplasm is a viscous fluid or jelly like material where organelles are embedded. Its jelly like feature secures the organelles in plants and animals so that they remain place.]
        <br><br>
        The Mitochondria are called "powerhouses" the of cells. They produce much of the energy a plant or animal cell needs to carry out its functions. They are the centers of cellular respiration, a process in which energy-rich ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate) that functions in energy storage and transfer is produced.
        <br><br>
        A vacuole is the storage area of the cell. Vacuoles store water, food, and waste. Animals have a very small vacuole while plants as the producers through the process of photosynthesis. have a big central vacuole.
        <br><br>
        The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is series of tunnels throughout the cytoplasm.
        <br><br>
        They transport proteins from one part of the cell to another that is why they are called as the transport center of the cell.
        <br><br>
        Endoplasmic reticulum in plants and animals form a network of tiny canals through the cell. These canals are formed by two parallel membranes. They connect the nuclear membrane and the plasma membrane thus serving as passageway for food substances.
        <br><br>
        Two types of Endoplasmic Reticulum:
        <br><br>
        Smooth ribosome free and functions in detoxification of lipids.
        <br><br>
        Rough contains ribosomes and releases newly made protein from the cell..
        <br><br>
        Ribosomes are the protein factories_of the cell. These are very essential since all the functions and processes in plant and animal cell requires protein. Even all the organelles inside the cell are made up of proteins making ribosomes very important.
        <br><br>
        Golgi bodies receive proteins and other compounds from the ER. They package these materials. and distribute them to the plant and animal parts of the cell.
        <br><br>
        Lysosomes hydrolytic contain enzymes that can break things down. Lysosomes pick up bacteria, food, and old organelles in plant and animal cell and break them into small pieces that can be reused.
        <br><br>
        The cytoskeleton is a series of fibers made from proteins. It provides structure to the cell and gives it its shape.
        <br><br>
        Components of cytoskeleton
        <br><br>
        Microtubules absent in plant cell, it provide pathways for certain cellular molecules to move about just as tracks are provided for railroad cars or trains. It is also found in structures like the cilia and flagella which both aid in movement. For examples, the cells that line your windpipe use cilia to sweep foreign materials from the lungs. Sperm cells use flagella to move. It is also involve in cell division as a mitotic spindle.
        <br><br>
        Intermediate filaments these are absent in plants. Since they are the most stable component of the cytoskeleton, they are found in durable structures such as hair, scales and fingernails. They also help provide structure to the nuclear envelope.
        <br><br>
        Microfilaments pipe-like structures and help provide shape and movement for the cells. Examples of microfilaments are found in muscle cells.
        <br><br>
        Cell wall is a rigid organelle composed of cellulose that gives plant cell its box-like shape. The cell wall consist of several distinct layers. The primary cell wall is the outer layer, it expands as the cell grows. As the plant reaches its full size, a secondary cell wall develops inside the primary cell wall. This new layer adds strength to the wall. Two primary cell walls of adjacent cells are separated by another layer, the middle lamella which is composed of like Jelly polysaccharide called pectin. Both the primary and secondary walls are composed mainly of polysaccharide cellulose which is commercially important as the main component of paper and cotton. Aside for cellulose, the secondary walls usually contain lignin, a complex organic compound that adds hardness and rigidity to cell walls.
        <br><br>
        Plastids are double membrane bound organelles found in plants. It is basically the storage of their pigments. Types of Plastids include the Leucoplasts which are colorless organelles that store starch and Chromoplasts which contain colored pigments like chloroplast.
        <br><br>
        Centrioles are paired organelles found only in animal cell. They are located together near the nucleus, at right angles to each other. They are essential building cilia and flagella and also as spindle fiber during cell division.
        <br><br>
        <strong>School as an Analogy for Cell Structure and Function</strong>
        <br><br>
        The parts of the school are like the parts of the cell, keep reading and see how their functions are almost the samet
        <br><br>
        <li>Security guard- cell membrane because the guard chooses who can enter or leave the school, only those with student I.D can enter.</li>
        <br><br>
        <li>School perimeter cytoplasm because it is where all the parts and processes of the school can be found.</li>
        <br><br>
        <li>Principal nucleus because the principal is the person in authority inside the school especially in terms of management and decision making.</li>
        <br><br>
        <li>DepEd-nucleolus because they are the ones responsible for hiring and producing teachers like how nucleolus produces the ribosomes.</li>
        <br><br>
        <li>Teachers- Ribosomes because they are the ones active in making the students the best person that they can be.</li>
        <br><br>
        <li>Classrooms- Golgi Body because it is where the students are taught and package physically, mentally, socially and spiritually.</li>
        <br><br>
        <li>Canteen- Mitochondria because the food served in the canteen gives energy to the students and teachers.</li>
        <br><br>
        <li>Janitor/Maintenance Team-Lysosome because lie lysosome they get rid of trashes by cleaning the school premises.</li>
        <br><br>
        <li>Hallways and corridor endoplasmic reticulum because they are the passageway that could be used to transport services, materials and processes involve in the teaching and learning process.</li>
        
        <h2>LESSON 3:PROKARYOTIC VS. EUKARYOTIC </h2>

        Comparing Prokaryotic Cell and Eukaryotic Cell
        <br><br>
        Cells fall into one of two broad categories: prokaryotic and eukaryotic. The predominantly single-celled organisms of the domains Bacteria and Archaea are classified as prokaryotes (pro- before, karyon nucleus). Animal cells, plant cells, fungi, and protists are eukaryotes (eu- true).
        <br><br>
        Components of Prokaryotic Cell
        <br><br>
        All cells share four common components:
        <br><br>
        1 A plasma membrane, an outer covering that separates the cell's interior from its surrounding environment.
        <br><br>
        2 Cytoplasm, consisting of a jelly-like region within the cell in which other cellular components are found.
        <br><br>
        3 DNA, the genetic material of the cell; and
        <br><br>
        4 ribosomes, particles that synthesize proteins. However, prokaryotes differ from eukaryotic cells in several ways.
        <br><br>
        A prokaryotic cell is a simple, single-celled (unicellular) organism that lacks a nucleus, or any other membrane-bound organelle. We will shortly come to see that this is significantly different in eukaryotes. Prokaryotic DNA is found in the central part of the cell: a darkened region called the nucleoid. (Figure 1).
        <br><br>
        Unlike Archaea and eukaryotes, bacteria have a cell wall made of peptidoglycan, comprised of sugars and amino acids, and many have a polysaccharide capsule (Figure 1). The cell wall acts as an extra layer of protection, helps the cell maintain its shape, and prevents dehydration. The capsule enables the cell to attach to surfaces in its environment. Some prokaryotes have flagella, pili, or fimbriae. Flagella are used for locomotion. Pili are used to exchange genetic material during a type of reproduction called conjugation. Fimbriae are protein appendages used by bacteria to attach to other cells.
        <br><br>
        Components of Eukaryotic Cell
        <br><br>
        What are the key features of eukaryotic cells? Unlike prokaryotic cells, eukaryotic cells have:
        <br><br>
        1. A membrane-bound nucleus, a central cavity surrounded by membrane that houses the cell's genetic material.
        <br><br>
        2. A number of membrane-bound organelles, compartments with specialized functions that float in the cytosol. (Organelle means "little organ," and this name reflects that the organelles, like the organs of our body, have unique functions as part of a larger system.)
        <br><br>
        3. Multiple linear chromosomes, as opposed to the single circular chromosome of a prokaryote. 
        <br><br>
        Eukaryotic cells are much more complicated than those of prokaryotes. They are packed with a fascinating array of subcellular structures that play important roles in energy balance, metabolism, and gene expression.
        <br><br>
        A eukaryote is an organism made up of one or more eukaryotic cells. All multicellular organisms are made of eukaryotic cells. The DNA of a eukaryotic cell is found in an internal compartment of the cell called the nucleus. All eukaryotic cells have membrane-bound organelles. An organelle is a small structure found in the cytoplasm that carries out specific activities inside the cell. Each organelle in a eukaryotic cell performs distinct functions. The complex organization of eukaryotic cells. enables them to carry out more specialized functions than prokaryotic cells.

        
        <h2>LESSON 4:CELL TYPES</h2>

        <strong>The four basic types of Animal Tissue</strong>
        <br><br>
        <strong>Epithelial tissue</strong> is type of tissue made up of tightly packed cells. commonly seen outside the body as coverings or as linings of organs and cavities. Examples of epithelial tissue include the skin, the lining of the mouth and nose, and the lining of the digestive system.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Cells</strong> that make up epithelial tissues can have a distinct arrangement:
        <br><br>
        <strong>Cuboidal</strong>-The tissue is made of cube-shaped cells, it is for secretion.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Simple columnarbrick</strong>-shaped cell for secretion and active absorption.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Simple squamous</strong>-plate-like cells for exchange of material through diffusion
        <br><br>
        Stratified squamous-multilayered and regenerates quickly; for protection
        <br><br>
        <strong>Pseudo-stratified columnar</strong>- single layer cells; may just look stacked because of varying height; for lining of respiratory tract; usually lined with cilia.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Connective tissues</strong> are made up of fibrous cells. Blood and bone are examples of specialized connective tissues. The cells of the connective tissue are separate by nonliving material called extracellular matrix. These tissues help hold other tissues together like during the formation of organs and have the ability to stretch and contract positively.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Blood</strong> is made up of plasma (le., liquid extracellular matrix) that contains water, salts, and dissolved proteins; erythrocytes that carry oxygen (RBC), leukocytes for defense (WBC), and platelets for blood clotting. It is the only fluid connective tissue..
        <br><br>
        <strong>Connective tissue</strong> proper (CTP) is made up of loose connective tissue that is made up of collagenous fibers found in tendons and ligaments (holds bones together and keeps them in place). Adipose tissues are examples of loose connective tissues that store fats which functions to insulate the body and store energy.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Cartilage</strong> is characterized by collagenous fibers embedded in chondroitin sulfate. Chondrocytes are the cells that secrete collagen and chondroitin sulfate. Cartilage functions as cushion between bones. They are present at the tips of external ears, bronchi, vertebral column, etc.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Bone</strong> is a mineralized connective tissue made by bone-forming cells called osteoblasts which deposit collagen. It is a hard-connective tissue which forms the framework of the body. The matrix of collagen is combined with calcium, magnesium, and phosphate tons to make the bone hard. Blood vessels and nerves are found at a central canal surrounded by concentric circles of osteons.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Muscle tissues</strong> are tissues composed of long cells called muscle fibers that allow the body to move voluntary or involuntary. Movement of muscles is a response to signals coming from nerve cells. In vertebrates, these muscles can be categorized into the following:
        <br><br>
        <strong>Skeletal</strong> -striated in appearance; voluntary movements
        <br><br>
        <strong>Cardiac</strong> striated with intercalated disk for synchronized heart contraction; involuntary
        <br><br>
        <strong>Smooth</strong>-not striated muscle with tampered ends; involuntary
        
        <h2>LESSON 5:CELL MODIFICATION</h2>

        Sperm Cell
        <br><br>
        Sperm cells are produced in the testes. The sperm cell is small and streamlined, allowing it to move easily and has a flagellum (a whip-like tail) that propels it. The function of these celis is to fertilize eggs cells during reproduction, Sperm cells contain half the number of chromosomes as the other in the body.
        <br><br>
        Root Hair Cell
        <br><br>
        Root hair cells are found in the roots of plants and absorb water for the plant more efficiently. Water is a reactant used in photosynthesis; the chemical reaction plants use to make their own food.
        <br><br>
        Microvilli
        <br><br>
        Microvilli, in the most simplistic terms, are tiny little microscopic projections that exist in, on, and around cells. They can exist on their own or in conjunction with villi (projections of same mucous membranes, most specifically of the small intestine, which are tiny folds that project out like numerous fingers). It may sweep unwanted materials toward a resorptive area of the cell. They are also involved in a wide variety of other functions, which include absorption, secretion, cellular adhesion, and mechanotransduction.
        <br><br>
        Cilia and Flagella
        <br><br>
        Cilia and flagella are fine, whiplike/hairlike structures that extend from the body of a variety of cells. While they vary in terms of length and numbers in different types of cells (as well as patterns of movement), cilia and flagella are generally identical in structure and composition. Cilia can e used for filtering air (in the trachea, for example) or for movement while flagella are used for movement
        <br><br>
        Nerve Cells
        <br><br>
        Mostly elongated, facilitate the transmission of impulses from the brain and the spinal cord to the different roots of the body.
        
        <h2>LESSON 6:PHASES OF THE CELL CYCLE</h2>

        The cell cycle can be thought of as the life cycle of a cell in other words, it is the series of growth and development steps a cell undergoes bet ween its "birth"-formation by the division of a mother cell reproduction division to make two new daughter cells.
        <br><br>
        Stages of the cell cycle
        <br><br>
        To divide, a cell must complete several important tasks: it must grow. copy its genetic material (DNA), and physically split into two daughter cells. Cella perform these tasks in an organized, predictable series of steps that make up the cell cycle. The cell cycle is a cycle, rather than a linear pathway, because at the end of each go-round, the two daughter cells can start the exact same process over again from the beginning.
        <br><br>
        In eukaryotic cells, or cells with a nucleus, the stages of the cell cycle interphase and the mitotic (M) phase are divided into two major phases:

        <li>During interphase the cell grows and makes a copy of its DNA.</li>

        <li>During the mitotic (M) phase the cell separates its DNA into two sets and divides its cytoplasm, forming two new cells.</li>

        Interphase
        <br><br>
        Let's enter the cell cycle just as a cell forms, by division of its mother cell. What must this newborn cell do next if it wants to go on and divide itself? Preparation for division happens in three steps:

        <li>G1 phase. During G1 phase, also called the first gap phase, the cell grows physically larger, copies organelles, and makes the molecular building blocles it will need in later steps.</li>

        <li>S phase. In 5 phase, the cell synthesizes a complete copy of the DNA in its nucleus. It also duplicates a microtubule organizing structure called the centresome. The centrosomes help separate DNA during M phase.</li>

        <li>G2 phase. During the second gap phase, or G2 phase, the cell grows more, makes proteins and organelles, and begins to reorganize its contents in preparation for mitosis, G2 phase ends when mitnsis hegins.</li>

        The G1, S, and G2 phases together are known as interphase. The prefix inter-means between, reflecting that interphase takes place between one mitotic (M) phase and the next.
        <br><br>
        M phase
        <br><br>
        During the mitotic (M) phase, the cell divides its copied DNA and cytoplasm to make two new cells. M phase involves two distinct division-related processes: mitosis and cytokinesis.
        <br><br>
        In mitosis, the nuclear DNA of the cell condenses into visible chromosomes and is pulled apart by the mitotic spindle, a specialized structure made out of microtubules. Mitosis takes place in four stages: prophase (sometimes divided into early prophase and prometaphase), metaphase, anaphase, and telophase.
        <br><br>
        In cytokinesis, the cytoplasm of the cell is split in two, making two new cells. Cytokinesis usually begins just as mitosis is ending, with a little overlap. Importantly, cytokinesis takes place differently in animal and plant cells.
        <br><br>
        In animals, cell division occurs when a band of cytoskeletal fibres called the contractile ring contracts inward and pinches the cell in two, a process called contractile cytokinesis. The indentation produced as the ring contracts inward is called the cleavage furrow. Animal cells can be pinched in two because they're relatively soft and squishy.
        <br><br>
        <li>Plant cells are much stiffer than animal cells; they're surrounded by a rigid cell wall and have high internal pressure. Because of this, plant cells divide in two by building a new structure down the middle of the cell. This structure, known as the cell plate, is made up of plasma membrane and cell wall components delivered in vesicles, and it partitions the cell in two.</li>
        <br><br>
        GO Phase
        <br><br>
        While some cells are constantly dividing, some cell types are at rest. These cells may exit G1 and enter a resting state called GO. In GO, a cell is performing its function without actively preparing to divide. GO is a permanent state for some cells, while others may re-start division if they get the right signals.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Cell cycle checkpoints</strong>

        A checkpoint is a stage in the eukaryotic cell cycle at which the cell examines internal and external cues and "decides" whether or not to move forward with division.
        <br><br>
        There are a number of checkpoints, but the three most important ones are:
        <br><br>
        <li>The G1 checkpoint, at the G1/S transition.</li>

        <li>The G2 checkpoint, at the G2/M transition.</li>

        <li>The spindle checkpoint, at the transition from metaphase to anaphase</li>

        The G1 checkpoint
        <br><br>
        The G1 checkpoint is the main decision point for a cell primary point at which it must choose whether or not to divide. Once the cell passes the G1 checkpoint and enters S phase, it becomes irreversibly committed to division. That is, barring unexpected problems, such as DNA damage or replication errors, a cell that passes the G1 checkpoint will continue the rest of the way through the cell cycle and produce two daughter cells.
        <br><br>
        At the G1 checkpoint, a cell checks whether internal and external conditions are right for division. Here are some of the factors a cell might assess:
        <br><br>
        <li>Size. Is the cell large enough to divide?</li>
        Nutrients. Does the cell have enough energy reserves or available nutrients to divide?
        <br><br>
        Molecular signals. Is the cell receiving positive cues (such as growth factors) from neighbors?
        <br><br>
        DNA integrity. Is any of the DNA damaged?
        <br><br>
        These are not the only factors that can affect progression through the G1 checkpoint, and which factors are most important depend on the type of cell. For instance, some cells also need mechanical cues (such as being attached to a supportive network called the extracellular matrix) in order to divide.
        <br><br>
        If a cell doesn't get the go-ahead cues it needs at the G1 checkpoint, it may leave the cell cycle and enter a resting state called GO phase. Some cells stay permanently in GO, while others resume dividing if conditions improve.
        <br><br>
        The G2 checkpoint
        <br><br>
        DNA replication. Was the DNA completely copied during S phase?
        <br><br>
        If errors or damage are detected, the cell will pause at the G2 checkpoint to allow for repairs. If the checkpoint mechanisms detect problems with the DNA, the cell cycle is halted, and the cell attempts to either complete DNA replication or repair the damaged DNA.
        <br><br>
        If the damage is irreparable, the cell may undergo apoptosis, or programmed cell death. This self-destruction mechanism ensures that damaged DNA is not passed on to daughter cells and is important in preventing cancer.
        <br><br>
        <strong>The spindle checkpoint</strong>
        <br><br>
        The M checkpoint is also known as the spindle checkpoint: here, the cell examines whether all the sister chromatids are correctly attached to the spindle microtubules. Because the separation of the sister chromatids during anaphase is an irreversible step, the cycle will not proceed until all the chromosomes are firmly attached to at least two spindle fibers from opposite poles of the cell.
        <br><br>
        How does this checkpoint work? It seems that cells don't actually scan the metaphase plate to confirm that all of the chromosomes are there. Instead, they look for "straggler" chromosomes that are in the wrong place (e.g.. floating around in the cytoplasm). If a chromosome is misplaced, the cell will pause mitosis, allowing time for the spindle to capture the stray chromosome.
        <br><br>
        Regulation
        <br><br>
        The progression of cells through the cell cycle is controlled by checkpoints at different stages. These detect if cell contains damaged DNA and ensure those cells do not replicate. The Restriction point (R) is located at G1 and is a key checkpoint. The vast majority of cells that pass through the R point will end up completing the entire cell cycle. Other checkpoints are located at the transitions between Gl and S, and G2 and M.
        <br><br>
        If damaged DNA is detected at any checkpoint, activation of the checkpoint results in increased protein p53 production. p53 is a tumor suppressor gene that stops the progression of the cell cycle and starts repair mechanisms for the damaged DNA. If this DNA cannot be repaired, then it ensures the cell undergoes apoptosis and can no longer replicate.
        <br><br>
        This cell cycle is also closely regulated by cyclins which control cell progression by activating cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) enzymes.
        <br><br>
        An example of a tumor suppressor protein would be retinoblastoma protein (Rb). Rb restricts the ability of a cell to progress from G1 to S phase in the cell cycle. CDK phosphorylates Rb to pRb, making it unable to restrict cell proliferation. This allows cells to divide normally in the cell cycle.
        
        <h2>LESSON 7:STAGES OF MITOSIS/MEIOSIS</h2>

        The Cell Cycle and Cell Division
        <br><br>
        Cell Division Functions in Reproduction, Growth, and Repair
        <br><br>
        Cell division Involves the distribution of identical genetic material, DNA, to two daughter cells. What is most remarkable is the fidelity with which the DNA is passed along, without dilution or error, from one generation to the next.
        <br><br>
        Core Concepts.
        <br><br>
        - All Organisms Consist of Cells and Arise from Preexisting Cells
        <br><br>
        Mitosis is the process by which new cells are generated.
        <br><br>
        Melosis is the process by which gametes are generated for reproduction.
        <br><br>
        The Cell Cycle Represents All Phases in the Life of a Coll
        <br><br>
        DNA replication (5 phase) must precede mitosis, so that all daughter cells receive the same complement of chromosomes as the parent cell.
        <br><br>
        The gap phases separate mitosis from $ phase. This is the time when molecular signals mediate the switch in cellular activity.
        <br><br>
        Mitosis involves the separation of copied chromosomes into separate cells Unregulated Cell Division Can Lead to Cancer
        <br><br>
        Cell-cycle checkpoints normally ensure that DNA replication and mitosis occur only when conditions are favorable and the process is working correctly.
        <br><br>
        Mutations in genes that encode cell-cycle proteins can lead to unregulated growth, resulting in tumor formation and ultimately invasion of cancerous cells to another organ.
        <br><br>
        -In order to better understand the concept of cell division and genetics, some basic definitions are in order 
        <br><br>
        gene-basic unit of heredity; codes for a specific trait
        <br><br>
        locus the specific location of a gene on a chromosome (locus plural loci) genome the total hereditary endowment of DNA of a cell or organism
        <br><br>
        somatic cell-all body cells except reproductive cells gamete reproductive cells (Le. sperm & eggs)
        <br><br>
        chromosome elongate cellular structure composed of DNA and protein - they are the vehicles which carry DNA in cells
        <br><br>
        diplold (2n) - cellular condition where each chromosome type is represented by two homologous chromosomes
        <br><br>
        haplold (n)-cellular condition where each chromosome type is represented by only one chromosome
        <br><br>
        homologous chromosome chromosome of the same size and shape which cary the same type of genes
        <br><br>
        chromatid one of two duplicated chromosomes connected at the centromere
        <br><br>
        centromere-region of chromosome where microtubules attach during mitosis and melosis
        <br><br>
        Chromosome structure
        <br><br>
        Composed of DNA and protein (histones) all tightly wrapped up in one package.
        <br><br>
        Duplicated chromosomes are connected by a centromere.
        <br><br>
        THE CELL CYCLE
        <br><br>
        Interphase
        <br><br>
        The "resting" or non-mitotic portion of the cell cycle.
        <br><br>
        It is comprised of G1. S. and G2 stages of the cell cycle.
        <br><br>
        -DNA is replicated during the 5 phase of interphase.
        <br><br>
        Mitosis-nuclear/chemical events resulting in two daughter nuciel which have Identical genetic material to each other and to the mother cell.
        <br><br>
        Cytokinesis-division of the cytoplasm. This usually occurs with mitosis, but in some organisms, this is not so.
        <br><br>
        MITOSIS
        <br><br>
        Prophase the first stage of mitosis.
        <br><br>
        The chromosomes condense and become visible.
        <br><br>
        The centrioles form and move toward opposite ends of the cell (the poles).
        <br><br>
        The nuclear membrane dissolves.
        <br><br>
        The mitotic spindle forms (from the centrioles in animal cells).
        <br><br>
        Spindle fibers from each centriole attach to each sister chromatid at the kinetochore.
        <br><br>
        Metaphase
        <br><br>
        The Centrioles complete their migration to the poles.
        <br><br>
        The chromosomes iline up in the middle of the cell ("the equator").
        <br><br>
        Anaphase
        <br><br>
        Spindles attached to kinetochores begin to shorten.
        <br><br>
        This exerts a force on the sister chromatids that pulls them apart.
        <br><br>
        Spindle fibers continue to shorten, pulling chromatids to opposite poles.
        <br><br>
        This ensures that each daughter cell gets identical sets of chromosomes.
        <br><br>
        Telophase
        <br><br>
        The chromosomes decondense.
        <br><br>
        The nuclear envelope forms.
        <br><br>
        Cytokinesis reaches completion, creating two daughter cells.
        <br><br>
        Cytokinesis Divides the Cytoplasm
        <br><br>
        In animal cells, cytokinesis occurs by a process known as cleavage furrow, a shallow groove near the location of the old metaphase plate.
        <br><br>
        Cytokinesis in plant cells is different because plant cells have cell walls. There is no cleavage furrow, During telophase, vesicles from the Golgi apparatus move along microtubules to the middle of the cell [where the cell plate was) and coalesce, producing the cell plate.
        <br><br>
        Chromosome Separation is the Key Event of Mitosis
        <br><br>
        Mitotic spindle fibers are the railroad tracks for chromosome movement.
        <br><br>
        Spindle fibers are made of microtubules,
        <br><br>
        Microtubules are lengthened and shortened by the addition and loss of tubulin subunits.
        <br><br>
        Mitotic spindle shortening during anaphase is a result of the loss of tubulin subunits.
        <br><br>
        A kinetochore motor is the engine that drives chromosome movement.
        <br><br>
        Multiple studies have shown that the kinetochore contains motor proteins that can walk along the spindie fiber during anaphase.
        <br><br>
        These proteins presumably remove tubulin subunits, shortening spindle fibers and facilitating the chromosome movement.
        <br><br>
        Melosis
        <br><br>
        Allele alternate forms of the same gene Homozygous having two identical alleles for a given gene
        <br><br>
        Heterozygous-having two different alleles for a given gene
        <br><br>
        Genotype genetic makeup of an organism
        <br><br>
        Phenotype the expressed traits of an organism
        <br><br>
        Melosis is a special type of cell division that occurs in sexually reproducing organisms.
        <br><br>
        o Melosis reduces the chromosome number by half, enabling sexual recombination to occur
        <br><br>
        Melosis of diploid cells produces haploid daughter cells, which may function as gametes.
        <br><br>
        Gametes undergo fertilization, restoring the diploid number of chromosomes in the zygote
        <br><br>
        Melosis and fertilization introduce genetic variation in three ways:
        <br><br>
        Crossing over between homologous chromosomes at prophase 1.
        <br><br>
        Independent assortment of homologous pairs at metaphase 1:
        <br><br>
        Each homologous pair can orient in either of two ways at the plane of cell division.
        <br><br>
        The total number of possible outcomes = 2n (n = number of haploid chromosomes).
        <br><br>
        The stages of meiosis can be broken down into two main stages. Melosis I and Melosis II:
        <br><br>
        Melosis I can be broken down into four sub stages: Prophase I. Metaphase I. Anaphase I and Telophase 1.
        <br><br>
        Melosis II can be broken down into four substages: Prophase II, Metaphase II. Anaphase II and Telophase II.
        <br><br>
        MEIOSIS I
        <br><br>
        Prophase I-most of the significant processes of Melosis occur during Prophase I
        <br><br>
        The chromosomes condense and become visible
        <br><br>
        The centrioles form and move toward the poles
        <br><br>
        The nuclear membrane begins to dissolve
        <br><br>
        The homologs pair up, forming a tetrad
        <br><br>
        Each tetrad is comprised of four chromatids the two homologs, each with their sister and Telophase 1.
        <br><br>
        Homologous chromosomes will swap genetic material in a process known as crossing over (abbreviated as XO).
        <br><br>
        Metaphase 1
        <br><br>
        Microtubules grow from the centrioles and attach to the centromeres.
        <br><br>
        The tetrads line up along the cell equator.
        <br><br>
        Anaphase 1
        <br><br>
        The centromeres break and homologous chromosomes separate [note that the sister chromatids are still attached).
        <br><br>
        Cytokinesis begins during this phase.
        <br><br>
        Telophase 1
        <br><br>
        The chromosomes may decondense (depends on specie s).
        <br><br>
        Cytokinesis reaches completion, creating two naplold daughter cells.
        <br><br>
        MEIOSIS II
        <br><br>
        Prophase II
        <br><br>
        Centrioles form and move toward the poles,
        <br><br>
        The nuclear membrane dissolves.
        <br><br>
        Metaphase II
        <br><br>
        Microtubules grow from the centrioles and attach to the centromeres.
        <br><br>
        The sister chromatids line up along the cell equator.
        <br><br>
        Anaphase II
        <br><br>
        The centromeres break and sister chromatids separate..
        <br><br>
        Cytokinesis begins.
        <br><br>
        Telophase II
        <br><br>
        The chromosomes may decondense (depends on species).
        <br><br>
        Cytokinesis reaches completion, creating four haploid daughter cells.
        <br><br>
        THE CANCER CELL
        <br><br>
        Cancer is when abnormal cells divide in an uncontrolled way. Some may eventually spread into other tissues. Also, there are more than 200 different types of cancer.
        <br><br>
        How does cancer start?
        <br><br>
        Cancer starts when gene changes make one cell or a few cells begin to grow and multiply too much. This may cause a growth called a tumor.
        <br><br>
        How does cancer grow?
        <br><br>
        Some cancers can spread to other parts of the body,
        <br><br>
        A primary tumor is the name for where a cancer starts.
        <br><br>
        Cancer can sometimes spread to other parts of the body; this is called a secondary tumor or a metastasis.
        <br><br>
        Cancer and its treatments can affect body systems, such as the blood circulation lymphatic and immune systems, and the hormone system.
        <br><br>
        How faulty genes lead to cancer?
        <br><br>
        -Our genes pick up mistakes that occur when cells divide. These mistakes are called faults or mutations and happen throughout our lives. They are caused by the natural processes in our cells, and by various other factors. These includes:
        <br><br>
        Tobacco smoke
        <br><br>
        Radiation
        <br><br>
        Ultraviolet radiation from the sun
        <br><br>
        Same substances in food
        <br><br>
        Chemicals in our environment
        <br><br>
        -There are four main types of gene involved in cell division. Most tumors have faulty coples of more than one of these types:
        <br><br>
        1. Genes that encourage the cell to multiply (oncogenes)
        <br><br>
        Oncogenes are genes that, under normal circumstances, play a role in telling cells to start multiplying and dividing. Normally, in aduits, this would not happen very often.
        <br><br>
        2. Genes that stop the coll multiplying (tumor suppressor genos)
        <br><br>
        Usually, cells can repair faults in their genes. If the damage is very bad, genes called tumor suppressor genes may stop the cell growing and dividing. Mutations in tumor suppressor genes mean that a cell no longer understands the instruction to stop growing and starts to multiply out of control. This can lead to cancer. The best-known tumor suppressor gene is p53. The p53 gene is damaged or missing in most human cancers
        <br><br><br>
        3. Genes that repair other damaged genes (DNA repair genes)
        <br><br>
        The DNA in every cell in our body is constantly in danger of being damaged. But cells contain many different proteins whose job is to repair damaged DNA. But if the DNA damage occurs to a gene that makes a DNA repair protein, a cell has less ability to repair itselt.
        <br><br>
        4. Genes that tell a cell to die (self-destruction genes)
        <br><br>
        Some genes normally tell a cell to self-destruct if it has become too old or damaged. This is called apoptosis or programmed cell death, It is a highly complex and very important process. Cells usually die whenever something goes wrong, to prevent a cancer forming.
        <br><br>
        Why cancer might come back?
        <br><br>
        Cancer may come back some time after its initial treatment. This idea can be frightening There are a number of different reasons for why cancer might come back.
        <br><br>
        One reason is that the original treatment did not get rid of all the cancer cells and those that were left grew into a new tumor. Another is that some cancer cells have spread to other parts of the body and gradually grown there to form a tumor.
        <br><br>
        The main categories of cancer.
        <br><br>
        Cancers can be grouped according to the type of cell they start in. There are 5 main categories:
        <br><br>
        Carcinoma-cancer that begins in the skin or in tissues that line or cover internal organs. There are a number of subtypes, including adenocarcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and transitional cell carcinoma.
        <br><br>
        Squamous cell carcinoma-starts in squamous cells. These are the flat, surface covering cells found in areas such as the skin or the lining of the throat or food pipe (esophagus).
        <br><br>
        Adenocarcinoma-start in glandular cells called adenomatous cells that produce fluids to keep tissues moist.
        <br><br>
        Transitional coil carcinoma-cells that can stretch as an organ expands, and they make up fissues called transitional epithelium. An example is the lining of the bladder.
        <br><br>
        Sarcoma- cancer that begins in the connective or supportive tissues such as bone, cartilage, fat, muscle, or blood vessels
        <br><br>

        b. Myeloma is also known as multiple myeloma. It is a cancer that starts in plasта севк Plasma cells are a type of white blood cell made in the bone marrow. They produce antibodies, also called immunoglobulin, to help fight infection. In myeloma, the plasma cells become abnormal, multiply uncontrollably, and make only one type of antibody that does not work properly to fight infection.

        Brain and spinal cord cancers-these are known as central nervous system cancers. 
        <br><br>
        Cancer can start in the cells of the brain or spinal cord.
        <br><br>
        The most common type of brain tumor develops from glial cells and is called glioma. Some tumors that start in the brain or spinal cord are non-cancerous (benign) and grow very slowly but others are cancerous and are more likely to grow and spread.
        <br><br>
        Cancers can also be classified according to where they start in the body, such as breast cancer or lung cancer.
        <br><br>
        Stages of Cancer
        <br><br>
        Staging is a way of describing the size of a cancer and how far it has grown. Several testes are carried out to check how big the cancer is and whether it has spread into surrounding fissues. They also check to see whether it has spread to another part of the body.
        <br><bR>
        Why staging is Important?
        <br><br>
        Staging is important because it helps your treatment team to know which treatments you need. If a cancer is just in one place, then a local treatment such as surgery or radiotherapy. could be enough to get rid of it completely. A local treatment treats only one area of the body.
        <br><br>
        Stage 1- usually means that a cancer is relatively small and contained within the organ it started in. 
        <br><br>
        Stage 2 usually means the cancer has not started to spread into surrounding tissue but the tumor is larger than in stage 1. Sometimes stage 2 means that cancer cells have spread into lymph nodes close to the tumor. This depends on the particular type of cancer.
        <br><br>
        Stage 3 usually means the cancer is larger. It may have started to spread into surrounding tissues and there are cancer cells in the lymph nodes in the area.
        <br><br>
        Stage 4- means the cancer has spread from where it started to another body organ. This is also called secondary or metastatic cancer
        
        <h2>LESSON 8:SIGNIFICANCE OR APPLICATIONS OF MITOSIS/MEIOSIS</h2>
    
        The processes of mitosis and meiosis are not just processes that are included in the cell cycle. These two are very significant to organisms especially in growth and development, repair, and reproduction. Below are the different body processes of organisms that involves mitosis and meiosis.
        <br><br>
        Why are mitosis and meiosis significant to organisms?
        <br><br>
        Significance of mitosis for sexual reproduction: Mitosis is indirectly important for sexual reproduction. It allows the sexually reproducing organism to grow and develop from a single cell into a sexually mature individual. This allows organisms to continue to reproduce through the generations.
        <br><br>
        Significance of Meiosis and Chromosome Number: Chromosomes are the cell's way of neatly arranging long strands of DNA. Non-sex cells have two sets of chromosomes, one set from each parent. Meiosis makes sex cells with only one set of chromosomes. For example, human cells have 46 chromosomes, with the exception of sperm and eggs, which contain only 23 chromosomes each. When a sperm cell fertilizes an egg, the 23 chromosomes from each sex cell combine to make a zygote, a new cell with 46 chromosomes. The zygote is the first cell in a new individual.
        <br><br>
        Significance of Meiosis for Diversity: One of the benefits of sexual reproduction is the diversity it produces within a population. That variety is a direct product of meiosis. Every sex cell made from melosis has a unique combination of chromosomes. This means that no two sperm or egg cells are genetically identical. Every fertilization event produces new combinations of traits. This is why siblings share DNA with parents and each other, but are not identical to one another.
        <br><br>
        Spermatogenesis - the process of sperm production.
        <br><br>
        Oogenesis - the process of egg formation.
        <br><br>
        Budding-is a type of asexual reproduction in which a new organism develops from an outgrowth or bud due to cell division at one particular site.
        <br><br>
        Regeneration is a type of asexual reproduction in which the organism is capable of re-growing certain body parts.
        <br><br>
        Asexual reproduction is a type of reproduction which does not involve the fusion of gametes or change in the number of chromosomes.
        <br><br>
        Sexual reproduction-involves two parents and produces offspring -that are genetically unique.
        
        <h2>LESSON 9:DISORDERS AND DISEASES</h2>

        Mistakes during cell division frequently generate changes in chromosome content. Errors in cell division can be categorized into the following:
        <br><br>
        A. Nondisjunction. This happens when the sister chromatids fail to separate. One cell is given three copies (trisomy) of a chromosome while the other gets only one (monosomy). Nondisjunction causes errors in chromosome number such as Trisomy 21 (Down Syndrome) and monosomy X (Turner syndrome. It is also common cause of early spontaneous abortions.
        <br><br>
        B. Deletion. Sometimes during mitosis, the chromosomes can be damaged. If the chromosomes gets broken the fragments can be lost. If this happens the genetic material, they contain is deleted. Deletions are responsible for an array of genetic disorders, including some cases of male infertility, Duchene muscular dystrophy and cystic fibrosis, and spinal muscular atrophy, the most common genetic cause of infant death. Symptoms of spinal muscular atrophy includes muscle weakness and decreased muscle tone, limited mobility, breathing problems, delayed gross motor skills and scoliosis.
        <br><br>
        C. Duplication. In chromosomal duplications, extra copies of a chromosomal region are formed, resulting in different copy numbers of genes within that area of the chromosome, Duplications may affect phenotype by altering gene dosage. Example of a disease resulting from chromosomal duplication is the Charcot-Marie Tooth disease type. It is one of the most common inherited nerve disorder characterized by a progressive loss of muscle tissue and touch sensation across various parts of the body, from the arms, legs to the spinal cord and brain.
        <br><br>
        D. Translocation. If the chromosome breaks, it can reattach. Sometimes it reattaches to the wrong chromosome. In reciprocal translocation, segments from two different chromosomes are exchanged while in Robertsonian translocation, an entire chromosome attaches to another. Translocations generate novel chromosomes but are often linked to disorders like infertility and cancer. Several forms of cancer are caused by acquired translocations which has been described mainly in leukemia. Chromosomal translocation can also result to infertility in which one of the would-be parents carries a balanced translocation, where the parents are asymptomatic but conceived fetuses are not viable.
        <br><br>
        E. Inversion. When the fragment gets reattached, it gets reattached to the right chromosome but upside down. When this happens, it gives incorrect codes for information. In some cases, chromosomal inversion has been associated with congenital anomalies, growth retardation, infertility, recurrent pregnancy loss, and cancer.
        <br><br>
        Mitosis is a process where a single cell divides into two identical daughter cells (cell division). During mitosis one cell divides once to form two identical cells. The major purpose of mitosis is for growth and to replace worn out cells. If not corrected in time, mistakes made during mitosis can result in changes in the DNA that can potentially lead to genetic disorders.
        <br><br>
        Although errors in mitosis are rare, the process may go wrong especially during early cellular divisions in the zygote. Mitotic errors can be especially dangerous to the organism because future offspring from this parent cell will carry the same disorder such as the following:
        <br><br>
        Cancer. The Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA), sometimes called a genetic blueprint. contains the hereditary material in nearly all organisms. The improper copying of DNA produces two types of errors, or mutations. Silent mutations have no impact on the DNA sequence, but missense mutations, which alter amino acid sequences, often impact the associated function. Missense mutations can multiply over time, leading to cell cycle disruption and the formation of tumors, which are the product of runaway cell reproduction. Cancer occurs when mutated cells ignore or override the normal "checkpoints" regulating mitosis and begin to reproduce uncontrollably.
        <br><br>
        Hemophilia. It is a blood-clotting disorder which is linked to what geneticist refer to as Mosaicism, wherein some cells may have a mutant version of a gene while others have the normal version of the same gene.
        <br><br>
        Marfan syndrome. It is a genetic disorder that affects the body's connective tissue, Connective tissue holds all the body's cells, organs and tissue together. It also plays an important role in helping the body grow and develop properly. Connective tissue is made up of proteins. The protein that plays a role in Marfan syndrome is called fibrillin-1. Marfan syndrome is caused by a defect (or mutation) in the gene that tells the body how to make fibrillin-1. This mutation results in an increase in a protein called transforming growth factor beta, or TGF-B. The increase in TGF-
        <br><br>
        B causes problems in connective tissues throughout the body, which in turn creates the features and medical problems associated with Marfan syndrome and some related conditions. Because connective tissue is found throughout the body, Marfan syndrome can affect many different parts of the body, as well. Features of the disorder are most often found in the heart, blood vessels, bones, joints, and eyes. Some Marfan features for example, aortic enlargement (expansion of the main blood vessel that carries blood away from the heart to the rest of the body) can be life-threatening. The lungs, skin and nervous system may also be affected. Marfan syndrome does not affect intelligence.
        
        <h2>LESSON 10:STRUCTURAL COMPONENT OF CELL MEMBRANE</h2>

        The Cell Membrane
        <br><br>
        Cell Membrane (also known as plasma membrane) is a physical and chemical barrier which separates the inside and outside of the cell providing fixed environment inside the cell. It is a bilayer of lipid with embedded proteins, in which the proteins and lipids.
        <br><br>
        1.Integral proteins as their name suggests, integrated into the membrane proteins that penetrate the lipid bilayer. They pass entirely through the lipid bilayer and protrude from both the extracellular and cytoplasmic sides of the cell membrane.
        <br><br>
        2.Peripheral proteins are membrane proteins that are associated within the surface of the cell membrane and found either on the cytoplasmic or extracellular side. Unlike integral protein, they do not stick into the hydrophobic core of the membrane and they tend to be more loosely attached.
        <br><br>
        Carbohydrates
        <br><br>
        Carbohydrates are the third major component of the cell membrane. In general, they are found on the outside surface of the cells and are bound either in protein forming glycoproteins or to lipids forming glycolipids. These carbohydrates may consist of 2-00 monosaccharide units and can either be straight or branched.
        <br><br>
        The Fluid Mosaic Model
        <br><br>
        The fluid mosaic model describes the cell membrane as several molecules (phospholipid, cholesterol and proteins) that are constantly moving. This movement helps the cell membrane maintains its role as a barrier between the inside and outside of the cell environment.
        <br><br>
        The fluidity of a cell membrane depends on the lipid composition of the membrane, the density of integral proteins, and the temperature. The fatty ac.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Role of Fatty Acids</strong>
        <br><br>
        The structure of the fatty acid tails of the phospholipid is important in determining how fluid is the membrane. Saturated fatty acids have no double bonds, so they are relatively straight while unsaturated fatty acids contain one or more double bond, often resulting in a bend or kink.
        <br><br>
        A long chain of saturated fatty acids have greater interactions among themselves making the cell membrane stiffer. While more unsaturated fatty acids in the lipid tails make the membrane becomes less tightly packed resulting to the increase of the cell membrane fluidity. Thus, at cooler temperature the straight tails of saturated fatty acids can pack tightly together, making a dense and fairly rigid cell membrane while unsaturated fatty acid tails cannot pack together as tightly because of the bent structure of the tails making the cell membrane to stay fluid at lower temperature.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Role of Cholesterol</strong>
        <br><br>
        The presence of cholesterol in the membrane makes it possible for the cell membrane to maintain its fluidity across a wide range of temperatures. It helps to minimize the effects of temperature on fluidity. At low temperature, cholesterol increases the fluidity by keeping the phospholipids from packing tightly together while at high temperature, it reduces fluidity. In this way, cholesterol expands the range of the temperatures at which a membrane maintains a functional healthy fluidity.
        <br><br>
        The number of cholesterol molecules in the membrane can be as high as the number of phospholipids. A high amount of cholesterol in the phospholipid bilayer makes the cell membrane remains fluid. While having a high density of integral proteins makes the cell membrane have less fluid.
        <br><br>
        The Importance of Membrane Fluidity
        <br><br>
        Membrane fluidity provides a perfect compromise between a rigid structure which makes mobility absent and a completely fluid where mechanical support would be lacking. It also allows interactions to take place within the membrane. Because of membrane fluidity, molecules that interact can come together, carry out the necessary reaction, and move apart.
        <br><br>
        Basic cellular processes, including cell movement, cell growth, cell division, formation of intercellular junctions, secretion, and endocytosis, depend on the fluidity of the cell membrane.

        <br><br>
        Semi-permeability property of the membrane that allow selective entry and/or exit of materials into/from the cell.
        <br><br>
        The plasma membrane is the edge of life, the boundary that separates the living cell from its surroundings and controls traffic into and out of the cell it surrounds. Like all biological membranes, the plasma membrane exhibits selective permeability; that is, it allows some substances to cross it more easily than others. The ability of the cell to discriminate in its chemical exchanges with its environment is fundamental to life, and it is the plasma membrane and its component molecules that make this selectivity possible.
        <br><br>
        The cell membrane possesses some effectively. These properties include (1) fluidity, (2) semi-permeability, and (3) rigidity. Fluidity and rigidity play their function for keeping the cell membrane intact, thus protecting the organelles inside while keeping out potential toxic materials. Being semi-permeable allows the cell membrane to study.com selectively allow entry and exit of materials through. Therefore, the two main function of the cell membrane are: (1) for protection and (2) for transport of materials in and out of the cell. Also, because of phospholipid bilayer's amphipathic molecular structure (hydrophobic tail and hydrophilic head), the cell membrane is stable.
        <br><br>
        Transport of molecules in and out of the cell is affected by the concentration gradient and the type of molecules that is to be transported. There are molecules that can easily enter and exit the cell membrane without the use of energy (passive), whereas there are those that ultimately requires the use of energy (ATP) to proceed. Concentration gradient easily affects the process, molecules move passively from regions with higher concentration, while they move actively (uses energy in the form of ATP) when moving from regions with low concentration towards a region with higher concentration
        
        <h2>LESSON 12:TRANSPORT MECHANISM IN CELL</h2>

        There are two major ways in which molecule or particies can move across a membrane. It is either by passive or active transport.
        <br><br>
        Passive Transport This process does not require energy for molecules to pass through the plasma membrane. Molecules move down their concentration gradient. A gradient is any imbalance in the concentration. Passive transport moves molecules from higher concentration to lower concentration. This process is carried out to maintain an equilibrium level in a cell. Passive transport moves molecules by Simple Diffusion, and Facilitated Diffusion or Osmosis.
        <br><br>
        Simple Diffusion allows non polar molecules such as oxygen (02) and carbon dioxide (CO2) to pass directly on the membrane. Facilitated Diffusion does not require energy but needs a membrane transport channel or carrier protein to transport ions such as sodium (Na+) and potassium (K+).
        <br><br>
        Osmosis is a special type of diffusion specifically associated with the movement of water molecules. A solution with higher concentration of solutes is said to be hypertonic while a solution with a lower concentration of solutes is hypotonic. Water crosses the membrane until the solute concentrations are equal on both sides. Solutions of equal solution concentration are said to be isotonic.
        <br><br>
        Active Transport is the movement of molecules from region of low concentration to high concentration. It occurs against a concentration gradient that is why it requires energy released from ATP (Adenosine triphosphate) for molecules. to pass through the cell membrane. Complex sugar, ions, large cells, proteins, and other particles are transported in this process. There are two categories: primary active transport and secondary active transport. Primary active transport uses energy usually through ATP hydrolysis. Secondary active transport relies on primary active transport, it requires energy and moves against a concentration gradients.
        <br><br>
        Exocytosis, endocytosis and sodium-potassium pump are a few examples of active transport. Large molecules enter the cell by generalized non-selective process known as endocytosis. Phagocytosis is endocytosis of a particulate material while pinocytosis is endocytosis of liquid material. In this process, the plasma membrane engulfs the particle or fluid droplet and pinches off a membranous sac or vesicles with a particular fluid inside into the cytoplasm. Exocytosis is the reverse process where a membrane bound vesicle filled with bulky materials moves to the plasma membrane and fuses with it. In this process, the vesicles contents are released out of the cell.
        
        <h2>LESSON 13:EXOCYTOSIS AND ENDOCYTOSIS</h2>

        In addition to moving small ions and molecules through the membrane, cells also need to remove and take in larger molecules and particles. Some cells are even capable engulfing entire of unicellular microorganisms. You might have correctly hypothesized that the uptake and release of large particles by the cell requires energy. A large particle, however, cannot pass through the membrane, even with energy supplied by the cell. Some molecules or particles are just too large to pass through the plasma membrane or to move through a transport protein. So cells use two other active transport processes to move these macromolecules (large molecules) into or out of the cell. Vesicles or other bodies in the cytoplasm move macromolecules or large particles across the plasma membrane.
        <br><br>
        There are two types of vesicle transport, endocytosis and exocytosis (illustrated in the Figure below). Both processes are active transport processes, requiring energy.
        <br><br>
        Endocytosis' was given by Christain de Duve in the year 1963. Both the terms refers to the intake of material through the plasma membrane by forming vesicles which are a membrane-bound droplet located inside the cytoplasm of the cell. Endocytosis occurs in the animal cell and very rarely
        in plant cell as the plant cell is surrounded by the cell wall, which causes hindrance in the invagination of the plasma membrane.
        <br><br>
        Transmission electron microscope image of brain tissue that shows pinocytotic vesicles. Pinocytosis is a type of endocytosis
        <br><br>
        Endocytosis is a type of active transport that moves particles, such as large molecules, parts of cells, and even whole cells, into a cell. There are different variations of endocytosis, but all share a common characteristic: the plasma membrane of the cell invaginates, forming a pocket around the target particle. The pocket pinches off, resulting in the particle being contained in a newly created intracellular vesicle formed from the plasma. membrane.
        <br><br>
        THREE TYPES OF ENDOCYTOSIS
        <br><br>
        1. PHAGOCYTOSIS
        <br><br>
        Phagocytosis (the condition of "cell eating") is the process by which large particles, such as cells or relatively large particles, are taken in by a cell. For example, when microorganisms invade the human body, a type of white blood cell called a neutrophil will remove the invaders through this process, surrounding and engulfing the microorganism, which is then destroyed by the neutrophil (see figure 1 below).
        <br><br>
        2. PINOCYTOSIS
        <br><br>
        This literally means "cell drinking". It is the intake of liquid and small particles usually, ions, amino acids, sugars, insulin, and lipoproteins. It was named at a time when the assumption was that the cell was purposefully taking in extracellular fluid. In reality, this is a process that takes in molecules, including water, which the cell needs from the extracellular fluid. Pinocytosis results in a much smaller vesicle than phagocytosis, and the vesicle does not need to merge with a lysosome (see Figure 2 below).
        <br><br>
        The vacuoles or vesicles formed in caveolae (singular caveola) are smaller than those in pinocytosis. Potocytosis is used to bring small molecules into the cell and to transport these molecules through the cell for their release on the other side of the cell, a process called transcytosis.
        <br><br>
        3. RECEPTOR-MEDIATED ENDOCYTOSIS
        <br><br>
        A targeted variation of endocytosis employs receptor proteins in the plasma membrane that have a specific binding affinity for certain substances (Figure 3 below).
        <br><br>
        In receptor-mediated endocytosis, as in phagocytosis, clathrin is attached to the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane. If uptake of a compound is dependent on receptor-mediated endocytosis and the process is Ineffective, the material will not be removed from the tissue fluids or blood. Instead, it will stay in those fluids and increase in concentration.
        <br><br>
        Some human diseases are caused by the failure of receptor-mediated endocytosis. For example, the form of cholesterol termed low-density lipoprotein or LDL (also referred to as "bad" cholesterol) is removed from the blood by receptor-mediated endocytosis. In the human genetic disease familial hypercholesterolemia, the LDL receptors are defective or missing entirely. People with this condition have life-threatening levels of cholesterol in their blood, because their cells cannot clear LDL particles from their blood.
        <br><br>
        Although receptor-mediated endocytosis is designed to bring specific substances that are normally found in the extracellular fluid into the cell, other substances may gain entry into the cell at the same site. Flu viruses, diphtheria, and cholera toxin all have sites that cross-react with normal receptor-binding sites and gain entry into cells.
        <br><br>
        EXOCYTOSIS is the reverse process of moving material into a cell is the process of exocytosis. Exocytosis is the opposite of the processes discussed in the last section in that its purpose is to expel material from the cell into the extracellular fluid. Waste material is enveloped in a membrane and fuses with the interior of the plasma membrane. This fusion opens the membranous envelope on the exterior of the cell, and the waste material is expelled into the extracellular space (see Figure 4 below).

        <h2>LEESON 14:OXIDATION AND REDUCTION REACTIONS</h2>

        An oxidation-reduction (redox) reaction is a type of chemical reaction that involves a transfer of electrons between two compounds. An oxidation-reduction reaction is any chemical reaction in which the oxidation number of a molecule, atom, or ion changes by gaining or losing an electron. Redox reactions are common and vital to some of the basic functions of life, including photosynthesis, respiration, combustion, and corrosion or rusting.
        <br><br>
        Oxidation-reduction reaction are also called REDOX reactions.
        <br><br>
        All redox reactions involve the transfer of electrons from one atom to another.
        <br><br>
        Spontaneous redox reactions are generally exothermic, and we can use the released energy as a source of energy for other applications.
        <br><br>
        Oxidation is gain of oxygen.
        <br><br>
        Reduction is loss of oxygen.
        <br><br>
        Redox reactions are comprised of two parts, a reduced half, and an oxidized half, that ALWAYS occur together. The reduced half gains electrons and the oxidation number decreases, while the oxidized half loses electrons and the oxidation number increases.
        <br><br>
        Simple ways to remember this include the mnemonic devices OIL RIG, meaning "Oxidation Is Loss" and "Reduction Is Gain," and LEO says GER, meaning "Loss of e Oxidation" and "Gain of e Reduction."
        <br><br>
        There is no net change in the number of electrons in a redox reaction. Those given off in the oxidation half reaction are taken up by another species in the reduction half reaction.

        A good example of a redox reaction is the extraction of Iron (Fe) from its ore, Ferric oxide (FeO). In which, Ferric oxide lose or give up oxygen (O) atoms to produce Iron (Fe). Carbon monoxide (CO) gains oxygen atoms to produce CO (carbon dioxide).

        REDUCTION can be defined as removal of oxygen from a substance or addition of hydrogen to a substance.

        <h2>LESSON 15:DETERMINE HOW FACTORS SUCH AS PH,TEMPERATURE,AND SUBTRATE AFFECT ENZYME ACTIVITY</h2>

        Inside the human body, a series of metabolic pathways break down a variety of food materials from large and complex biomolecules into smaller, easier to absorb molecules, producing energy and the raw materials to build body components, such as brain, blood, and muscle tissue. Furthermore, other forms of life-animals, plants, protists, fungi, and other microorganisms need enzyme to break down large molecules or build new ones to carry out their life functions.
        <br><br>
        Numerous chemical reactions happen within a human body. All chemical reaction requires a starting energy called activation energy to get started. Still, these reactions materialize too slowly on their own. To speed up the rate of a chemical reaction, it needs a substance called catalyst.
        <br><br>
        Inside the living organisms, cells make use of special proteins called enzymes that act as biological catalyst to lower activation energies and change the rate of a chemical reactions, but they are themselves unchanged by the reaction. Enzymes, speed up the rate of a reaction, are large, complex protein that consists of one or more polypeptide chains.
        <br><br>
        Enzymes catalyze all varieties of chemical reactions that are engaged in body growth and development, blood coagulation, healing, disease, respiration, digesting food, reproduction, muscle and nerve function and many other biological activities.
        <br><br>
        Enzymes are identified after their substrates, the substance the enzyme acts. upon. Generally, the name of an enzyme ends in ase. For instance, a lipase acts on lipids, a protease acts on proteins and amylase acts on starch. The active site is the specific part where the substrates bind to a site on the enzyme. An induced fit is a change in the shape of an enzyme permitting it to respond effectively with a substrate.
        <br><br>
        On an enzyme, the active site has a unique three-dimensional shape that can create a complex only with one kind of substrate. Substrates attach to the enzyme at these active sites, creating an enzyme-substrate complex. The enzyme's action occurs while the enzyme and the substrate are bound together, as the substrate molecule must fit precisely into an active site. At this time, bonds of the substrate may be weakened as it consequently lowers the activation energy needed to break the bond. The substrate, now a product, then separates from the enzyme.
        <br><br>
        Furthermore, the action of enzymes is often assisted by cofactors, which can be inorganic ions or other substances. For instance, carbonic anhydrase, an enzyme if not attached to a zinc ion the body's pH cannot function. Cofactors that are nonprotein organic molecules are called coenzyme such as vitamins. The enzyme will not function if the coenzyme part is missing.

        Oxidation/Reduction Reactions
        <br><br>
        Enzymes perform a substantial role in connecting the series of redox reactions eventually involving oxygen. Certain enzymes carry oxidation reduction reactions. Oxidase, oxygenase and oxidoreductase to name a few.
        <br><br>
        When an atom or molecule loses an electron, it is said to be oxidized, and the process is called oxidation. In biological systems, oxygen is the most common electron acceptor since it attracts electrons strongly. On the contrary, when an atom or molecule gains an electron, it is said to be reduced, and the process is called reduction. Oxidation and reduction always take place together as every electron that is lost by an atom through oxidation is gained by some other atom through reduction. Consequently, chemical reactions of this kind are called oxidation-reduction (redox) reactions.

        Factors Affecting Enzyme Activity
        <br><br>
        Temperature. The rate of enzyme action differs with temperature. Up to a point, the rate increases with increasing temperature. Temperature optimum is the temperature at which the enzyme functions most effectively. If the temperature is raised higher than the optimum, the rate of enzyme action starts to decrease. The decrease in enzyme action happens because the higher temperature destroys the shape of the enzyme.
        <br><br>
        Denaturation is the process at which the shape of the enzyme's active site is distorted so that it no longer matches the substrate. The normal human temperature is at 37°C, the temperature optimum for nearly all human enzymes. Denaturation of these enzymes starts at about 40°C and higher, disrupting the body's homeostasis. Bacteria have the temperature optima can be 70°C or higher since they exist in hot springs and have more stable enzymes.
        <br><br>
        PH. The rate of enzymatic action varies with pH of the environment. The pH scale is a measure of the hydrogen ion (H+) concentration of a solution. Solutions with a pH of 7 are neutral. Those with a pH below of 7 are acids, while those with a pH above 7 are bases. Most enzymes have a pH optimum that usually ranges from pH 6 to 8. Every enzyme has a distinct pH at which it operates most effectively. For instance, pepsin, an enzyme in the stomach, works best at pH of 2 and trypsin, an enzyme in the small intestine, works best at pH of 8.
        <br><br>
        Enzyme and Substrate Concentrations. The rate of enzyme action contrasts with the quantity of existing substrate. With a high concentration of enzyme and a low concentration of substrate, the rate of enzyme action. Increases as the substrate concentration increases. Moreover, where the entire enzyme molecules are responding, the rate levels off, and addition of further substrates has no extra result.
