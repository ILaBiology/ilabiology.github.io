    LESSON 3:CELLULAR RESPIRATION 
    <br><br>
    <strong>Cellular respiration</strong> is how cells get energy from glucose.
    <br><br>
    <strong>Aerobic respiration</strong> (with oxygen) glucose is broken down into pyruvic acid, which enters the mitochondria. In the Krebs cycle and electron transport chain, pyruvic acid is turned into carbon dioxide and water. This process releases a lot of ATP (energy).
    <br><br>
    <strong>Anaerobic respiration</strong> (without oxygen) pyruvic acid is changed into lactic acid. This only makes 2 ATP per glucose, much less energy.
