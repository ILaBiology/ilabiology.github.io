    <h2>LESSON 12:TRANSPORT MECHANISM IN CELL</h2>

    There are two major ways in which molecule or particies can move across a membrane. It is either by passive or active transport.
    <br><br>
    Passive Transport This process does not require energy for molecules to pass through the plasma membrane. Molecules move down their concentration gradient. A gradient is any imbalance in the concentration. Passive transport moves molecules from higher concentration to lower concentration. This process is carried out to maintain an equilibrium level in a cell. Passive transport moves molecules by Simple Diffusion, and Facilitated Diffusion or Osmosis.
    <br><br>
    Simple Diffusion allows non polar molecules such as oxygen (02) and carbon dioxide (CO2) to pass directly on the membrane. Facilitated Diffusion does not require energy but needs a membrane transport channel or carrier protein to transport ions such as sodium (Na+) and potassium (K+).
    <br><br>
    Osmosis is a special type of diffusion specifically associated with the movement of water molecules. A solution with higher concentration of solutes is said to be hypertonic while a solution with a lower concentration of solutes is hypotonic. Water crosses the membrane until the solute concentrations are equal on both sides. Solutions of equal solution concentration are said to be isotonic.
    <br><br>
    Active Transport is the movement of molecules from region of low concentration to high concentration. It occurs against a concentration gradient that is why it requires energy released from ATP (Adenosine triphosphate) for molecules. to pass through the cell membrane. Complex sugar, ions, large cells, proteins, and other particles are transported in this process. There are two categories: primary active transport and secondary active transport. Primary active transport uses energy usually through ATP hydrolysis. Secondary active transport relies on primary active transport, it requires energy and moves against a concentration gradients.
    <br><br>
    Exocytosis, endocytosis and sodium-potassium pump are a few examples of active transport. Large molecules enter the cell by generalized non-selective process known as endocytosis. Phagocytosis is endocytosis of a particulate material while pinocytosis is endocytosis of liquid material. In this process, the plasma membrane engulfs the particle or fluid droplet and pinches off a membranous sac or vesicles with a particular fluid inside into the cytoplasm. Exocytosis is the reverse process where a membrane bound vesicle filled with bulky materials moves to the plasma membrane and fuses with it. In this process, the vesicles contents are released out of the cell.
