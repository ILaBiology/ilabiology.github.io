    <h2>LESSON 10:STRUCTURAL COMPONENT OF CELL MEMBRANE</h2>

    The Cell Membrane
    <br><br>
    Cell Membrane (also known as plasma membrane) is a physical and chemical barrier which separates the inside and outside of the cell providing fixed environment inside the cell. It is a bilayer of lipid with embedded proteins, in which the proteins and lipids.
    <br><br>
    1.Integral proteins as their name suggests, integrated into the membrane proteins that penetrate the lipid bilayer. They pass entirely through the lipid bilayer and protrude from both the extracellular and cytoplasmic sides of the cell membrane.
    <br><br>
    2.Peripheral proteins are membrane proteins that are associated within the surface of the cell membrane and found either on the cytoplasmic or extracellular side. Unlike integral protein, they do not stick into the hydrophobic core of the membrane and they tend to be more loosely attached.

    Carbohydrates
    <br><br>
    Carbohydrates are the third major component of the cell membrane. In general, they are found on the outside surface of the cells and are bound either in protein forming glycoproteins or to lipids forming glycolipids. These carbohydrates may consist of 2-00 monosaccharide units and can either be straight or branched.

    The Fluid Mosaic Model
    <br><br>
    The fluid mosaic model describes the cell membrane as several molecules (phospholipid, cholesterol and proteins) that are constantly moving. This movement helps the cell membrane maintains its role as a barrier between the inside and outside of the cell environment.
    <br><br>
    The fluidity of a cell membrane depends on the lipid composition of the membrane, the density of integral proteins, and the temperature. The fatty ac.

    <strong>Role of Fatty Acids</strong>
    <br><br>
    The structure of the fatty acid tails of the phospholipid is important in determining how fluid is the membrane. Saturated fatty acids have no double bonds, so they are relatively straight while unsaturated fatty acids contain one or more double bond, often resulting in a bend or kink.
    <br><br>
    A long chain of saturated fatty acids have greater interactions among themselves making the cell membrane stiffer. While more unsaturated fatty acids in the lipid tails make the membrane becomes less tightly packed resulting to the increase of the cell membrane fluidity. Thus, at cooler temperature the straight tails of saturated fatty acids can pack tightly together, making a dense and fairly rigid cell membrane while unsaturated fatty acid tails cannot pack together as tightly because of the bent structure of the tails making the cell membrane to stay fluid at lower temperature.
    <br><br>
    <strong>Role of Cholesterol</strong>
    <br><br>
    The presence of cholesterol in the membrane makes it possible for the cell membrane to maintain its fluidity across a wide range of temperatures. It helps to minimize the effects of temperature on fluidity. At low temperature, cholesterol increases the fluidity by keeping the phospholipids from packing tightly together while at high temperature, it reduces fluidity. In this way, cholesterol expands the range of the temperatures at which a membrane maintains a functional healthy fluidity.
    <br><br>
    The number of cholesterol molecules in the membrane can be as high as the number of phospholipids. A high amount of cholesterol in the phospholipid bilayer makes the cell membrane remains fluid. While having a high density of integral proteins makes the cell membrane have less fluid.
    <br><br>
    The Importance of Membrane Fluidity
    <br><br>
    Membrane fluidity provides a perfect compromise between a rigid structure which makes mobility absent and a completely fluid where mechanical support would be lacking. It also allows interactions to take place within the membrane. Because of membrane fluidity, molecules that interact can come together, carry out the necessary reaction, and move apart.
    <br><br>
    Basic cellular processes, including cell movement, cell growth, cell division, formation of intercellular junctions, secretion, and endocytosis, depend on the fluidity of the cell membrane.
