    <h2>LESSON 4:CELL TYPES</h2>

    <strong>The four basic types of Animal Tissue</strong>
    <br><br>
    <strong>Epithelial tissue</strong> is type of tissue made up of tightly packed cells. commonly seen outside the body as coverings or as linings of organs and cavities. Examples of epithelial tissue include the skin, the lining of the mouth and nose, and the lining of the digestive system.
    <br><br>
    <strong>Cells</strong> that make up epithelial tissues can have a distinct arrangement:
    <br><br>
    <strong>Cuboidal</strong>-The tissue is made of cube-shaped cells, it is for secretion.
    <br><br>
    <strong>Simple columnarbrick</strong>-shaped cell for secretion and active absorption.
    <br><br>
    <strong>Simple squamous</strong>-plate-like cells for exchange of material through diffusion
    <br><br>
    Stratified squamous-multilayered and regenerates quickly; for protection
    <br><br>
    <strong>Pseudo-stratified columnar</strong>- single layer cells; may just look stacked because of varying height; for lining of respiratory tract; usually lined with cilia.
    <br><br>
    <strong>Connective tissues</strong> are made up of fibrous cells. Blood and bone are examples of specialized connective tissues. The cells of the connective tissue are separate by nonliving material called extracellular matrix. These tissues help hold other tissues together like during the formation of organs and have the ability to stretch and contract positively.
    <br><br>
    <strong>Blood</strong> is made up of plasma (le., liquid extracellular matrix) that contains water, salts, and dissolved proteins; erythrocytes that carry oxygen (RBC), leukocytes for defense (WBC), and platelets for blood clotting. It is the only fluid connective tissue..
    <br><br>
    <strong>Connective tissue</strong> proper (CTP) is made up of loose connective tissue that is made up of collagenous fibers found in tendons and ligaments (holds bones together and keeps them in place). Adipose tissues are examples of loose connective tissues that store fats which functions to insulate the body and store energy.
    <br><br>
    <strong>Cartilage</strong> is characterized by collagenous fibers embedded in chondroitin sulfate. Chondrocytes are the cells that secrete collagen and chondroitin sulfate. Cartilage functions as cushion between bones. They are present at the tips of external ears, bronchi, vertebral column, etc.
    <br><br>
    <strong>Bone</strong> is a mineralized connective tissue made by bone-forming cells called osteoblasts which deposit collagen. It is a hard-connective tissue which forms the framework of the body. The matrix of collagen is combined with calcium, magnesium, and phosphate tons to make the bone hard. Blood vessels and nerves are found at a central canal surrounded by concentric circles of osteons.
    <br><br>
    <strong>Muscle tissues</strong> are tissues composed of long cells called muscle fibers that allow the body to move voluntary or involuntary. Movement of muscles is a response to signals coming from nerve cells. In vertebrates, these muscles can be categorized into the following:
    <br><br>
    <strong>Skeletal</strong> -striated in appearance; voluntary movements
    <br><br>
    <strong>Cardiac</strong> striated with intercalated disk for synchronized heart contraction; involuntary
    <br><br>
    <strong>Smooth</strong>-not striated muscle with tampered ends; involuntary
    <br><br>
