<P>LESSON 7:STAGES OF MITOSIS/MEIOSIS</P>
The Cell Cycle and Cell Division
<br><br>
Cell Division Functions in Reproduction, Growth, and Repair
<br><br>
Cell division Involves the distribution of identical genetic material, DNA, to two daughter cells. What is most remarkable is the fidelity with which the DNA is passed along, without dilution or error, from one generation to the next.
<br><br>
Core Concepts.
<br><br>
- All Organisms Consist of Cells and Arise from Preexisting Cells
<br><br>
Mitosis is the process by which new cells are generated.
<br><br>
Melosis is the process by which gametes are generated for reproduction.
<br><br>
The Cell Cycle Represents All Phases in the Life of a Coll
<br><br>
DNA replication (5 phase) must precede mitosis, so that all daughter cells receive the same complement of chromosomes as the parent cell.
<br><br>
The gap phases separate mitosis from $ phase. This is the time when molecular signals mediate the switch in cellular activity.
<br><br>
Mitosis involves the separation of copied chromosomes into separate cells Unregulated Cell Division Can Lead to Cancer
<br><br>
Cell-cycle checkpoints normally ensure that DNA replication and mitosis occur only when conditions are favorable and the process is working correctly.
<br><br>
Mutations in genes that encode cell-cycle proteins can lead to unregulated growth, resulting in tumor formation and ultimately invasion of cancerous cells to another organ.
<br><br>
-In order to better understand the concept of cell division and genetics, some basic definitions are in order
<br><br>
gene-basic unit of heredity; codes for a specific trait
<br><br>
locus the specific location of a gene on a chromosome (locus plural loci) genome the total hereditary endowment of DNA of a cell or organism
<br><br>
somatic cell-all body cells except reproductive cells gamete reproductive cells (Le. sperm & eggs)
<br><br>
chromosome elongate cellular structure composed of DNA and protein - they are the vehicles which carry DNA in cells
<br><br>
diplold (2n) - cellular condition where each chromosome type is represented by two homologous chromosomes
<br><br>
haplold (n)-cellular condition where each chromosome type is represented by only one chromosome
<br><br>
homologous chromosome chromosome of the same size and shape which cary the same type of genes
<br><br>
chromatid one of two duplicated chromosomes connected at the centromere
<br><br>
centromere-region of chromosome where microtubules attach during mitosis and melosis
<br><br>
Chromosome structure
<br><br>
Composed of DNA and protein (histones) all tightly wrapped up in one package.
<br><br>
Duplicated chromosomes are connected by a centromere.
<br><br>
THE CELL CYCLE
<br><br>
Interphase
<br><br>
The "resting" or non-mitotic portion of the cell cycle.
<br><br>
It is comprised of G1. S. and G2 stages of the cell cycle.
<br><br>
-DNA is replicated during the 5 phase of interphase.
<br><br>
Mitosis-nuclear/chemical events resulting in two daughter nuciel which have Identical genetic material to each other and to the mother cell.
<br><br>
Cytokinesis-division of the cytoplasm. This usually occurs with mitosis, but in some organisms, this is not so.
<br><br>
MITOSIS
<br><br>
Prophase the first stage of mitosis.
<br><br>
The chromosomes condense and become visible.
<br><br>
The centrioles form and move toward opposite ends of the cell (the poles).
<br><br>
The nuclear membrane dissolves.
<br><br>
The mitotic spindle forms (from the centrioles in animal cells).
<br><br>
Spindle fibers from each centriole attach to each sister chromatid at the kinetochore.
<br><br>
Metaphase
<br><br>
The Centrioles complete their migration to the poles.
<br><br>
The chromosomes iline up in the middle of the cell ("the equator").
<br><br>
Anaphase
<br><br>
Spindles attached to kinetochores begin to shorten.
<br><br>
This exerts a force on the sister chromatids that pulls them apart.
<br><br>
Spindle fibers continue to shorten, pulling chromatids to opposite poles.
<br><br>
This ensures that each daughter cell gets identical sets of chromosomes.
<br><br>
Telophase
<br><br>
The chromosomes decondense.
<br><br>
The nuclear envelope forms.
<br><br>
Cytokinesis reaches completion, creating two daughter cells.
<br><br>
Cytokinesis Divides the Cytoplasm
<br><br>
In animal cells, cytokinesis occurs by a process known as cleavage furrow, a shallow groove near the location of the old metaphase plate.
<br><br>
Cytokinesis in plant cells is different because plant cells have cell walls. There is no cleavage furrow, During telophase, vesicles from the Golgi apparatus move along microtubules to the middle of the cell [where the cell plate was) and coalesce, producing the cell plate.
<br><br>
Chromosome Separation is the Key Event of Mitosis
<br><br>
Mitotic spindle fibers are the railroad tracks for chromosome movement.
<br><br>
Spindle fibers are made of microtubules,
<br><br>
Microtubules are lengthened and shortened by the addition and loss of tubulin subunits.
<br><br>
Mitotic spindle shortening during anaphase is a result of the loss of tubulin subunits.
<br><br>
A kinetochore motor is the engine that drives chromosome movement.
<br><br>
Multiple studies have shown that the kinetochore contains motor proteins that can walk along the spindie fiber during anaphase.
<br><br>
These proteins presumably remove tubulin subunits, shortening spindle fibers and facilitating the chromosome movement.
<br><br>
Melosis
<br><br>
Allele alternate forms of the same gene Homozygous having two identical alleles for a given gene
<br><br>
Heterozygous-having two different alleles for a given gene
<br><br>
Genotype genetic makeup of an organism
<br><br>
Phenotype the expressed traits of an organism
<br><br>
Melosis is a special type of cell division that occurs in sexually reproducing organisms.
<br><br>
o Melosis reduces the chromosome number by half, enabling sexual recombination to occur
<br><br>
Melosis of diploid cells produces haploid daughter cells, which may function as gametes.
<br><br>
Gametes undergo fertilization, restoring the diploid number of chromosomes in the zygote
<br><br>
Melosis and fertilization introduce genetic variation in three ways:
<br><br>
Crossing over between homologous chromosomes at prophase 1.
<br><br>
Independent assortment of homologous pairs at metaphase 1:
<br><br>
Each homologous pair can orient in either of two ways at the plane of cell division.
<br><br>
The total number of possible outcomes = 2n (n = number of haploid chromosomes).
<br><br>
The stages of meiosis can be broken down into two main stages. Melosis I and Melosis II:
<br><br>
Melosis I can be broken down into four sub stages: Prophase I. Metaphase I. Anaphase I and Telophase 1.
<br><br>
Melosis II can be broken down into four substages: Prophase II, Metaphase II. Anaphase II and Telophase II.
<br><br>
MEIOSIS I
<br><br>
Prophase I-most of the significant processes of Melosis occur during Prophase I
<br><br>
The chromosomes condense and become visible
<br><br>
The centrioles form and move toward the poles
<br><br>
The nuclear membrane begins to dissolve
<br><br>
The homologs pair up, forming a tetrad
<br><br>
Each tetrad is comprised of four chromatids the two homologs, each with their sister and Telophase 1.
<br><br>
Homologous chromosomes will swap genetic material in a process known as crossing over (abbreviated as XO).
<br><br>
Metaphase 1
<br><br>
Microtubules grow from the centrioles and attach to the centromeres.
<br><br>
The tetrads line up along the cell equator.
<br><br>
Anaphase 1
<br><br>
The centromeres break and homologous chromosomes separate [note that the sister chromatids are still attached).
<br><br>
Cytokinesis begins during this phase.
<br><br>
Telophase 1
<br><br>
The chromosomes may decondense (depends on specie s).
<br><br>
Cytokinesis reaches completion, creating two naplold daughter cells.
<br><br>
MEIOSIS II
<br><br>
Prophase II
<br><br>
Centrioles form and move toward the poles,
<br><br>
The nuclear membrane dissolves.
<br><br>
Metaphase II
<br><br>
Microtubules grow from the centrioles and attach to the centromeres.
<br><br>
The sister chromatids line up along the cell equator.
<br><br>
Anaphase II
<br><br>
The centromeres break and sister chromatids separate..
<br><br>
Cytokinesis begins.
<br><br>
Telophase II
<br><br>
The chromosomes may decondense (depends on species).
<br><br>
Cytokinesis reaches completion, creating four haploid daughter cells.
<br><br>
THE CANCER CELL
<br><br>
Cancer is when abnormal cells divide in an uncontrolled way. Some may eventually spread into other tissues. Also, there are more than 200 different types of cancer.
<br><br>
How does cancer start?
<br><br>
Cancer starts when gene changes make one cell or a few cells begin to grow and multiply too much. This may cause a growth called a tumor.
<br><br>
How does cancer grow?
<br><br>
Some cancers can spread to other parts of the body,
<br><br>
A primary tumor is the name for where a cancer starts.
<br><br>
Cancer can sometimes spread to other parts of the body; this is called a secondary tumor or a metastasis.
<br><br>
Cancer and its treatments can affect body systems, such as the blood circulation lymphatic and immune systems, and the hormone system.
<br><br>
How faulty genes lead to cancer?
<br><br>
-Our genes pick up mistakes that occur when cells divide. These mistakes are called faults or mutations and happen throughout our lives. They are caused by the natural processes in our cells, and by various other factors. These includes:
<br><br>
Tobacco smoke
<br><br>
Radiation
<br><br>
Ultraviolet radiation from the sun
<br><br>
Same substances in food
<br><br>
Chemicals in our environment
<br><br>
-There are four main types of gene involved in cell division. Most tumors have faulty coples of more than one of these types:
<br><br>
1. Genes that encourage the cell to multiply (oncogenes)
<br><br>
Oncogenes are genes that, under normal circumstances, play a role in telling cells to start multiplying and dividing. Normally, in aduits, this would not happen very often.
<br><br>
2. Genes that stop the coll multiplying (tumor suppressor genos)
<br><br>
Usually, cells can repair faults in their genes. If the damage is very bad, genes called tumor suppressor genes may stop the cell growing and dividing. Mutations in tumor suppressor genes mean that a cell no longer understands the instruction to stop growing and starts to multiply out of control. This can lead to cancer. The best-known tumor suppressor gene is p53. The p53 gene is damaged or missing in most human cancers
<br><br><br>
3. Genes that repair other damaged genes (DNA repair genes)
<br><br>
The DNA in every cell in our body is constantly in danger of being damaged. But cells contain many different proteins whose job is to repair damaged DNA. But if the DNA damage occurs to a gene that makes a DNA repair protein, a cell has less ability to repair itselt.
<br><br>
4. Genes that tell a cell to die (self-destruction genes)
<br><br>
Some genes normally tell a cell to self-destruct if it has become too old or damaged. This is called apoptosis or programmed cell death, It is a highly complex and very important process. Cells usually die whenever something goes wrong, to prevent a cancer forming.
<br><br>
Why cancer might come back?
<br><br>
Cancer may come back some time after its initial treatment. This idea can be frightening There are a number of different reasons for why cancer might come back.
<br><br>
One reason is that the original treatment did not get rid of all the cancer cells and those that were left grew into a new tumor. Another is that some cancer cells have spread to other parts of the body and gradually grown there to form a tumor.
<br><br>
The main categories of cancer.
<br><br>
Cancers can be grouped according to the type of cell they start in. There are 5 main categories:
<br><br>
Carcinoma-cancer that begins in the skin or in tissues that line or cover internal organs. There are a number of subtypes, including adenocarcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and transitional cell carcinoma.
<br><br>
Squamous cell carcinoma-starts in squamous cells. These are the flat, surface covering cells found in areas such as the skin or the lining of the throat or food pipe (esophagus).
<br><br>
Adenocarcinoma-start in glandular cells called adenomatous cells that produce fluids to keep tissues moist.
<br><br>
Transitional coil carcinoma-cells that can stretch as an organ expands, and they make up fissues called transitional epithelium. An example is the lining of the bladder.
<br><br>
Sarcoma- cancer that begins in the connective or supportive tissues such as bone, cartilage, fat, muscle, or blood vessels
<br><br>
◆ Bone sarcomas- Sarcomas of bone start from bone cells.
<br><br>
Soft fissue sarcomas Soft tissue sarcomas are rare but the most common types start in cartilage or muscle.
<br><br>
Cartilage-Cancer of the cartilage is called chondrosarcoma.
<br><br>
Muscle-Cancer of muscle collis is called rhabdomyosarcoma.
<br><br>
Leukemia-cancer that starts in blood forming tissue such as the bone marrow and causes large numbers of abnormal blood cells to be produced and go into the blood. "Cancers of blood cellt
<br><br>
A condition in which the bone marrow makes too many white blood cells. The blood cells are not fully formed and so don't work properly to fight infection. The cells build up in the blood..
<br><br>
Most common type of cancer in children.
<br><br>
Lymphoma and myeloma-cancers that begin in the cells of the immune system. "Lymphatic system cancers".
<br><br>
a. Lymphomas start from cells in the lymphatic system. The lymphatic system is a system of tubes and glands in the body that filters body fluid and fights infection. It is made up of the lymph glands, lymphatic vessels and the spleen, places such as the bone marrow or spleen
<br><br>
b. Myeloma is also known as multiple myeloma. It is a cancer that starts in plasта севк Plasma cells are a type of white blood cell made in the bone marrow. They produce antibodies, also called immunoglobulin, to help fight infection. In myeloma, the plasma cells become abnormal, multiply uncontrollably, and make only one type of antibody that does not work properly to fight infection.
<br><br>
Brain and spinal cord cancers-these are known as central nervous system cancers. 
<br><br>
Cancer can start in the cells of the brain or spinal cord.
<br><br>
The most common type of brain tumor develops from glial cells and is called glioma. Some tumors that start in the brain or spinal cord are non-cancerous (benign) and grow very slowly but others are cancerous and are more likely to grow and spread.
<br><br>
Cancers can also be classified according to where they start in the body, such as breast cancer or lung cancer.
<br><br>
Stages of Cancer
<br><br>
Staging is a way of describing the size of a cancer and how far it has grown. Several testes are carried out to check how big the cancer is and whether it has spread into surrounding fissues. They also check to see whether it has spread to another part of the body.
<br><bR>
Why staging is Important?
<br><br>
Staging is important because it helps your treatment team to know which treatments you need. If a cancer is just in one place, then a local treatment such as surgery or radiotherapy. could be enough to get rid of it completely. A local treatment treats only one area of the body.
<br><br>
Stage 1- usually means that a cancer is relatively small and contained within the organ it started in. 
<br><br>
Stage 2 usually means the cancer has not started to spread into surrounding tissue but the tumor is larger than in stage 1. Sometimes stage 2 means that cancer cells have spread into lymph nodes close to the tumor. This depends on the particular type of cancer.
<br><br>
Stage 3 usually means the cancer is larger. It may have started to spread into surrounding tissues and there are cancer cells in the lymph nodes in the area.
<br><br>
Stage 4- means the cancer has spread from where it started to another body organ. This is also called secondary or metastatic cancer
