    Introduction
    - Autotrophic Organisms and Chlorophyll:
     Autotrophic organisms use chlorophyll to capture sunlight and convert it into chemical energy stored in ATP and carbohydrates.

    -In eukaryotes, chlorophyll is found in the thylakoid membranes within chloroplasts. 

    - Three Key Photosynthesis Processes in Eukaryotes:

    1.  Energy absorption from sunlight via pigments during light-dependent reaction.
 
    2. Reaction Center Reactivation:

    3. Carbohydrate production through carbon fixation during dark reaction.

    - Carbon dioxide (CO2)

    - Water (H2O)

    - Sunlight

    • Products (Released Groups):

    - Glucose (C6H12O6)

    - Oxygen (O2)

    During Photosynthesis:

Energy from sunlight is captured and converted into chemical energy.

This energy is used to synthesize glucose (C6,H12,O6) from carbon dioxide (CO2 and water (H2O).

Photosynthesis transforms sunlight into usable chemical energy, making it the primary source of energy, for nearly all living organisms.

In eukaryotic cells, both light and dark reactions happen in the chloroplast: 

Light reactions – in the thylakoid membrane.

Dark reactions – in the stroma (fluid-filled area of the chloroplast).

The two stages of Photosynthesis:

1. Light reaction 

Occur in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts.

Use sunlight to:

Excite electrons, reducing NADP+ to NADPH.

Split water (H2O) molecules, releasing oxygen (O2) as a by-product.

Produce ATP through photophosphorylation.

Products: ATP, NADPH,and O2.

2. Calvin Cycle (Dark Reactions):

Occur in the stroma of the chloroplast.

Do not require sunlight directly. 

Use ATP and NADPH (from the light reactions) to:

Fix CO2 into organic molecules like glucose.

Return ADP, inorganic phospate, and NADP+ back to the light reactions.
•Final product: Carbohydrates (like glucose).

1. A pigment molecule absorb the light energy(proton) of the light-harvesting complex of Photosystem II, until the energy makes it to the reaction center. and absorbed by the P680 pair of chlorophyll a, in the reaction center.

2. In a pair of "chlorophyll a," an electron is raised to an excited state and then transferred to the primary electron acceptor. causing P680 to loses its electron and becomes positively charged

3. The water molecule is being attracted to the positively charged molecule, causing split-up of H₂O into two electrons, two hydrogen ions, and an oxygen atom with the provision of light energy. The two oxygen atoms immediately combine, which then released outside the leaf–stomata.

4. Photosystem I is reach after transporting  excited electrons from primary electron acceptor–electron carrier molecules–
electron transport chain. The electron carrier molecules involved are plastoquinone (Pq), a cytochrome complex, and plastocyanin (Pc).

5. At each transfer, electrons release small amounts of energy. Hydrogen ions are pumped across the membrane using this energy. an uneven distribution of hydrogen ions in the stroma and the lumen, consequently from the splitting up of water molecules. H+ ions try to equalize their distribution by moving from the lumen to the stroma through ATP synthase (with the aid of membrane protein). That is referred to as chemiosmosis. The synthesis of ATP from ADP is triggered by the movement of hydrogen ions through the ATP synthase channel. ATP contains high-energy phosphate bonds.


6.Meanwhile, reaching the reaction center complex of Photosystem I also absorbed a photon and passed energy from one pigment molecule to another. The energy excites the electron present in the pair of P700 chlorophyll a located here, then the primary electron acceptor is where the excited electron is transferred, resulting in P700 being positively charged and seeking electrons to fill the missing ones. resulting in the Photosystem II electrons filling it up through the electron transport chain.

7. The photo-excited electron from the primary electron acceptor of Photosystem I enters another electron transfer chain, passing the electron to an iron-containing protein called ferredoxin (Fd)


8.An enzyme, the NADP+ reductase, then transfers the electron to NADP+  and add proton(H+) to stabilize it to form NADPH. then released NADP+ to the stroma and becomes part of the Calvin Cycle.

Calvin Cycle  
- The Calvin Cycle is also known as the light-independent reactions or dark reactions of photosynthesis.  
- It takes place in the stroma of the chloroplast.  
- Its main purpose is to convert carbon dioxide (CO₂) into sugar using the energy from ATP and the reducing power of NADPH, both of which are produced during the light-dependent reactions.  
- The sugar produced is G3P (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate), a three-carbon molecule, not glucose directly.  
- This process is a form of carbon fixation, where inorganic CO₂ is incorporated into organic molecules.

THREE PHASES OF CALVIN CYCLE:
(Carbon Fixation)

- Carbon fixation is the process of incorporating an inorganic carbon molecule, CO2, into an organic material.

- In this phase, the CO2 molecule is attached to a five-carbon sugar molecule named ribulose biphosphate (RuBP) aided by an enzyme named rubisco or RuBP carboxylase. Rubisco is believed to be the most abundant protein in the chloroplast and maybe on Earth.

- The resulting product, a six-carbon sugar, is extremely unstable and immediately splits in half. The split forms two molecules of a 3-phosphoglycerate (3-carbon).

In short, carbon fixation is the first step where plants grab CO2 and start making sugars.

REDUCTION
•ATP and NADPH are used to change 6 molecules of 3-PGA into 6 molecules of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P).
•3-PGA gets energy from ATP to form 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate, making ADP.
•NADPH gives up energy and a hydrogen atom, becoming NADP+.
•The result is glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P), glucose with ADP and NADP+.
•ADP and NADP+ go back to the light-dependent reactions to be reused.

To form three molecules of RuBP we need Five molecules of G3P undergo a series of complex enzymatic reactions.
this deduct three molecules of AT in the cell, but provides another set of RuBP to continue the cycle.

What happens to G3P after its release from the cycle?

•G3Ps + G3Ps= either (glucose or fructose)
•Glucose + fructose= Surcose
•Glucose can be connected in chains to form starch.
•G3Ps can also be used in lipid and protein synthesis.

The cost of making carbohydrate:
To make one molecule of G3P, the chloroplast needs:

•3 molecules of CO2
•9 molecules of ATP
•6 molecules of NADPH
