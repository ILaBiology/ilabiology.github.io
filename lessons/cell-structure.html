    <h2>LESSON 2:CELL STRUCTURE AND FUNCTIONS</h2>

    Roles to Rules; Structure to function
    <br><br>
    All of the life processes of a living cell involve transformation of energy and matter. The source of this life energy is the molecules undergoing chemical activities within the cell. A living cell performs the following life processes:
    <br><br>
    1. Nutrition is the process by which cells obtain food molecules to support their other activities.
    <br><br>
    2. Digestion is the process by which food particles are broken down into smaller soluble units suitable for cell use with the help of enzymes.
    <br><br>
    3. Absorption is the process by which cells absorb water, minerals and other materials essential to life from their environment,
    <br><br>
    4. Biosynthesis is the process by which all cells organize complex chemicals from simple building units or substances.
    <br><br>
    5. Excretion is the process by which by-products of all cell activities which are not needed for further cell functioning are eliminated.
    <br><br>
    6. Egestion is the process by which insoluble, non-digested particles. are eliminated by the cell.
    <br><br>
    7. Secretion is the process by which substances that are synthesized by the cells are expelled from the membrane. This elimination process helps in the functioning of the body,
    <br><br>
    8. Movement is a process which includes the locomotion of cell by means of special structures like cilia or flagella.
    <br><br>
    9. Irritability is the process by which cells respond or react to external factors or conditions around them. Cells can alter their functions in response to changes their environment.
    <br><br>
    10. Respiration is the process of breaking down food molecules into
    chemical energy needed by all cells in order to function. 11. Reproduction is a process by which a cell copies or replicates its DNA and increases its number by cell division. It gives rise to new cells as a result, organisms grow.
    <br><br>
    The principal parts of a cell are:
    <br><br>
    1. Cell membrane
    <br><br>
    2. Cytoplasm
    <br><br>
    3. Nucleus
    <br><br>
    The nucleus is covered with a membrane that allows materials to pass in and out. It's often called the "control center" of the cell because it contains DNA. The nucleolus is where the ribosomes are formed and this structure can be found both in plants. and animals.
    <br><br>
    The cell membrane is a semi-permeable membrane that facilitate the movement of molecules inside and outside the plant or animal cell. It allows only chosen substances to enter or leave cell which can protect the cell from harmful substances.
    <br><br>
    The cell membrane is often pictured as fluid mosaic model. Fluidity becomes its characteristic because its molecules are constantly moving The phospholipid molecules move sideways within the membrane. Since the plasma membrane is fluid, it can seal itself if it is damaged or broken.
    <br><br>
    The cytoplasm is a viscous fluid or jelly like material where organelles are embedded. Its jelly like feature secures the organelles in plants and animals so that they remain place.]
    <br><br>
    The Mitochondria are called "powerhouses" the of cells. They produce much of the energy a plant or animal cell needs to carry out its functions. They are the centers of cellular respiration, a process in which energy-rich ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate) that functions in energy storage and transfer is produced.
    <br><br>
    A vacuole is the storage area of the cell. Vacuoles store water, food, and waste. Animals have a very small vacuole while plants as the producers through the process of photosynthesis. have a big central vacuole.
    <br><br>
    The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is series of tunnels throughout the cytoplasm.
    <br><br>
    They transport proteins from one part of the cell to another that is why they are called as the transport center of the cell.
    <br><br>
    Endoplasmic reticulum in plants and animals form a network of tiny canals through the cell. These canals are formed by two parallel membranes. They connect the nuclear membrane and the plasma membrane thus serving as passageway for food substances.
    <br><br>
    Two types of Endoplasmic Reticulum:
    <br><br>
    Smooth ribosome free and functions in detoxification of lipids.
    <br><br>
    Rough contains ribosomes and releases newly made protein from the cell..
    <br><br>
    Ribosomes are the protein factories_of the cell. These are very essential since all the functions and processes in plant and animal cell requires protein. Even all the organelles inside the cell are made up of proteins making ribosomes very important.
    <br><br>
    Golgi bodies receive proteins and other compounds from the ER. They package these materials. and distribute them to the plant and animal parts of the cell.
    <br><br>
    Lysosomes hydrolytic contain enzymes that can break things down. Lysosomes pick up bacteria, food, and old organelles in plant and animal cell and break them into small pieces that can be reused.
    <br><br>
    The cytoskeleton is a series of fibers made from proteins. It provides structure to the cell and gives it its shape.
    <br><br>
    Components of cytoskeleton
    <br><br>
    Microtubules absent in plant cell, it provide pathways for certain cellular molecules to move about just as tracks are provided for railroad cars or trains. It is also found in structures like the cilia and flagella which both aid in movement. For examples, the cells that line your windpipe use cilia to sweep foreign materials from the lungs. Sperm cells use flagella to move. It is also involve in cell division as a mitotic spindle.
    <br><br>
    Intermediate filaments these are absent in plants. Since they are the most stable component of the cytoskeleton, they are found in durable structures such as hair, scales and fingernails. They also help provide structure to the nuclear envelope.
    <br><br>
    Microfilaments pipe-like structures and help provide shape and movement for the cells. Examples of microfilaments are found in muscle cells.
    <br><br>
    Cell wall is a rigid organelle composed of cellulose that gives plant cell its box-like shape. The cell wall consist of several distinct layers. The primary cell wall is the outer layer, it expands as the cell grows. As the plant reaches its full size, a secondary cell wall develops inside the primary cell wall. This new layer adds strength to the wall. Two primary cell walls of adjacent cells are separated by another layer, the middle lamella which is composed of like Jelly polysaccharide called pectin. Both the primary and secondary walls are composed mainly of polysaccharide cellulose which is commercially important as the main component of paper and cotton. Aside for cellulose, the secondary walls usually contain lignin, a complex organic compound that adds hardness and rigidity to cell walls.
    <br><br>
    Plastids are double membrane bound organelles found in plants. It is basically the storage of their pigments. Types of Plastids include the Leucoplasts which are colorless organelles that store starch and Chromoplasts which contain colored pigments like chloroplast.
    <br><br>
    Centrioles are paired organelles found only in animal cell. They are located together near the nucleus, at right angles to each other. They are essential building cilia and flagella and also as spindle fiber during cell division.
    <br><br>
    <strong>School as an Analogy for Cell Structure and Function</strong>
    <br><br>
    The parts of the school are like the parts of the cell, keep reading and see how their functions are almost the samet
    <br><br>
    <li>Security guard- cell membrane because the guard chooses who can enter or leave the school, only those with student I.D can enter.</li>
    <br><br>
    <li>School perimeter cytoplasm because it is where all the parts and processes of the school can be found.</li>
    <br><br>
    <li>Principal nucleus because the principal is the person in authority inside the school especially in terms of management and decision making.</li>
    <br><br>
    <li>DepEd-nucleolus because they are the ones responsible for hiring and producing teachers like how nucleolus produces the ribosomes.</li>
    <br><br>
    <li>Teachers- Ribosomes because they are the ones active in making the students the best person that they can be.</li>
    <br><br>
    <li>Classrooms- Golgi Body because it is where the students are taught and package physically, mentally, socially and spiritually.</li>
    <br><br>
    <li>Canteen- Mitochondria because the food served in the canteen gives energy to the students and teachers.</li>
    <br><br>
    <li>Janitor/Maintenance Team-Lysosome because lie lysosome they get rid of trashes by cleaning the school premises.</li>
    <br><br>
    <li>Hallways and corridor endoplasmic reticulum because they are the passageway that could be used to transport services, materials and processes involve in the teaching and learning process.</li>
