<P>LESSON 15:DETERMINE HOW FACTORS SUCH AS PH,TEMPERATURE,AND SUBTRATE AFFECT ENZYME ACTIVITY</P>
Inside the human body, a series of metabolic pathways break down a variety of food materials from large and complex biomolecules into smaller, easier to absorb molecules, producing energy and the raw materials to build body components, such as brain, blood, and muscle tissue. Furthermore, other forms of life-animals, plants, protists, fungi, and other microorganisms need enzyme to break down large molecules or build new ones to carry out their life functions.
<br><br>
Numerous chemical reactions happen within a human body. All chemical reaction requires a starting energy called activation energy to get started. Still, these reactions materialize too slowly on their own. To speed up the rate of a chemical reaction, it needs a substance called catalyst.
<br><br>
Inside the living organisms, cells make use of special proteins called enzymes that act as biological catalyst to lower activation energies and change the rate of a chemical reactions, but they are themselves unchanged by the reaction. Enzymes, speed up the rate of a reaction, are large, complex protein that consists of one or more polypeptide chains.
<br><br>
Enzymes catalyze all varieties of chemical reactions that are engaged in body growth and development, blood coagulation, healing, disease, respiration, digesting food, reproduction, muscle and nerve function and many other biological activities.
<br><br>
Enzymes are identified after their substrates, the substance the enzyme acts. upon. Generally, the name of an enzyme ends in ase. For instance, a lipase acts on lipids, a protease acts on proteins and amylase acts on starch. The active site is the specific part where the substrates bind to a site on the enzyme. An induced fit is a change in the shape of an enzyme permitting it to respond effectively with a substrate.
<br><br>
On an enzyme, the active site has a unique three-dimensional shape that can create a complex only with one kind of substrate. Substrates attach to the enzyme at these active sites, creating an enzyme-substrate complex. The enzyme's action occurs while the enzyme and the substrate are bound together, as the substrate molecule must fit precisely into an active site. At this time, bonds of the substrate may be weakened as it consequently lowers the activation energy needed to break the bond. The substrate, now a product, then separates from the enzyme.
<br><br>
Furthermore, the action of enzymes is often assisted by cofactors, which can be inorganic ions or other substances. For instance, carbonic anhydrase, an enzyme if not attached to a zinc ion the body's pH cannot function. Cofactors that are nonprotein organic molecules are called coenzyme such as vitamins. The enzyme will not function if the coenzyme part is missing.
<br><br>
Oxidation/Reduction Reactions
<br><br>
Enzymes perform a substantial role in connecting the series of redox reactions eventually involving oxygen. Certain enzymes carry oxidation reduction reactions. Oxidase, oxygenase and oxidoreductase to name a few.
<br><br>
When an atom or molecule loses an electron, it is said to be oxidized, and the process is called oxidation. In biological systems, oxygen is the most common electron acceptor since it attracts electrons strongly. On the contrary, when an atom or molecule gains an electron, it is said to be reduced, and the process is called reduction. Oxidation and reduction always take place together as every electron that is lost by an atom through oxidation is gained by some other atom through reduction. Consequently, chemical reactions of this kind are called oxidation-reduction (redox) reactions.

Factors Affecting Enzyme Activity
<br><br>
Temperature. The rate of enzyme action differs with temperature. Up to a point, the rate increases with increasing temperature. Temperature optimum is the temperature at which the enzyme functions most effectively. If the temperature is raised higher than the optimum, the rate of enzyme action starts to decrease. The decrease in enzyme action happens because the higher temperature destroys the shape of the enzyme.
<br><br>
Denaturation is the process at which the shape of the enzyme's active site is distorted so that it no longer matches the substrate. The normal human temperature is at 37°C, the temperature optimum for nearly all human enzymes. Denaturation of these enzymes starts at about 40°C and higher, disrupting the body's homeostasis. Bacteria have the temperature optima can be 70°C or higher since they exist in hot springs and have more stable enzymes.
<br><br>
PH. The rate of enzymatic action varies with pH of the environment. The pH scale is a measure of the hydrogen ion (H+) concentration of a solution. Solutions with a pH of 7 are neutral. Those with a pH below of 7 are acids, while those with a pH above 7 are bases. Most enzymes have a pH optimum that usually ranges from pH 6 to 8. Every enzyme has a distinct pH at which it operates most effectively. For instance, pepsin, an enzyme in the stomach, works best at pH of 2 and trypsin, an enzyme in the small intestine, works best at pH of 8.
<br><br>
Enzyme and Substrate Concentrations. The rate of enzyme action contrasts with the quantity of existing substrate. With a high concentration of enzyme and a low concentration of substrate, the rate of enzyme action. Increases as the substrate concentration increases. Moreover, where the entire enzyme molecules are responding, the rate levels off, and addition of further substrates has no extra result.
