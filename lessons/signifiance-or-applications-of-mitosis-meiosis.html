<P>LESSON 8:SIGNIFICANCE OR APPLICATIONS OF MITOSIS/MEIOSIS</P>
The processes of mitosis and meiosis are not just processes that are included in the cell cycle. These two are very significant to organisms especially in growth and development, repair, and reproduction. Below are the different body processes of organisms that involves mitosis and meiosis.
<br><br>
Why are mitosis and meiosis significant to organisms?
<br><br>
Significance of mitosis for sexual reproduction: Mitosis is indirectly important for sexual reproduction. It allows the sexually reproducing organism to grow and develop from a single cell into a sexually mature individual. This allows organisms to continue to reproduce through the generations.
<br><br>
Significance of Meiosis and Chromosome Number: Chromosomes are the cell's way of neatly arranging long strands of DNA. Non-sex cells have two sets of chromosomes, one set from each parent. Meiosis makes sex cells with only one set of chromosomes. For example, human cells have 46 chromosomes, with the exception of sperm and eggs, which contain only 23 chromosomes each. When a sperm cell fertilizes an egg, the 23 chromosomes from each sex cell combine to make a zygote, a new cell with 46 chromosomes. The zygote is the first cell in a new individual.
<br><br>
Significance of Meiosis for Diversity: One of the benefits of sexual reproduction is the diversity it produces within a population. That variety is a direct product of meiosis. Every sex cell made from melosis has a unique combination of chromosomes. This means that no two sperm or egg cells are genetically identical. Every fertilization event produces new combinations of traits. This is why siblings share DNA with parents and each other, but are not identical to one another.
<br><br>
Spermatogenesis - the process of sperm production.
<br><br>
Oogenesis - the process of egg formation.
<br><br>
Budding-is a type of asexual reproduction in which a new organism develops from an outgrowth or bud due to cell division at one particular site.
<br><br>
Regeneration is a type of asexual reproduction in which the organism is capable of re-growing certain body parts.
<br><br>
Asexual reproduction is a type of reproduction which does not involve the fusion of gametes or change in the number of chromosomes.
<br><br>
Sexual reproduction-involves two parents and produces offspring -that are genetically unique.
