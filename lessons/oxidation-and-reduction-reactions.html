<P>LEESON 14:OXIDATION AND REDUCTION REACTIONS</P>
An oxidation-reduction (redox) reaction is a type of chemical reaction that involves a transfer of electrons between two compounds. An oxidation-reduction reaction is any chemical reaction in which the oxidation number of a molecule, atom, or ion changes by gaining or losing an electron. Redox reactions are common and vital to some of the basic functions of life, including photosynthesis, respiration, combustion, and corrosion or rusting.
<br><br>
Oxidation-reduction reaction are also called REDOX reactions.
<br><br>
All redox reactions involve the transfer of electrons from one atom to another.
<br><br>
Spontaneous redox reactions are generally exothermic, and we can use the released energy as a source of energy for other applications.
<br><br>
Oxidation is gain of oxygen.
<br><br>
Reduction is loss of oxygen.
<br><br>
Redox reactions are comprised of two parts, a reduced half, and an oxidized half, that ALWAYS occur together. The reduced half gains electrons and the oxidation number decreases, while the oxidized half loses electrons and the oxidation number increases.
<br><br>
Simple ways to remember this include the mnemonic devices OIL RIG, meaning "Oxidation Is Loss" and "Reduction Is Gain," and LEO says GER, meaning "Loss of e Oxidation" and "Gain of e Reduction."
<br><br>
There is no net change in the number of electrons in a redox reaction. Those given off in the oxidation half reaction are taken up by another species in the reduction half reaction.
<br><br>
A good example of a redox reaction is the extraction of Iron (Fe) from its ore, Ferric oxide (FeO). In which, Ferric oxide lose or give up oxygen (O) atoms to produce Iron (Fe). Carbon monoxide (CO) gains oxygen atoms to produce CO (carbon dioxide).
<br><br>
OXIDATION can be defined as addition of oxygen to a substance or removal of hydrogen from a substance.
<br><br>
REDUCTION can be defined as removal of oxygen from a substance or addition of hydrogen to a substance.
