    <h2>LESSON 9:DISORDERS AND DISEASES</h2>

    Mistakes during cell division frequently generate changes in chromosome content. Errors in cell division can be categorized into the following:
    <br><br>
    A. Nondisjunction. This happens when the sister chromatids fail to separate. One cell is given three copies (trisomy) of a chromosome while the other gets only one (monosomy). Nondisjunction causes errors in chromosome number such as Trisomy 21 (Down Syndrome) and monosomy X (Turner syndrome. It is also common cause of early spontaneous abortions.
    <br><br>
    B. Deletion. Sometimes during mitosis, the chromosomes can be damaged. If the chromosomes gets broken the fragments can be lost. If this happens the genetic material, they contain is deleted. Deletions are responsible for an array of genetic disorders, including some cases of male infertility, Duchene muscular dystrophy and cystic fibrosis, and spinal muscular atrophy, the most common genetic cause of infant death. Symptoms of spinal muscular atrophy includes muscle weakness and decreased muscle tone, limited mobility, breathing problems, delayed gross motor skills and scoliosis.
    <br><br>
    C. Duplication. In chromosomal duplications, extra copies of a chromosomal region are formed, resulting in different copy numbers of genes within that area of the chromosome, Duplications may affect phenotype by altering gene dosage. Example of a disease resulting from chromosomal duplication is the Charcot-Marie Tooth disease type. It is one of the most common inherited nerve disorder characterized by a progressive loss of muscle tissue and touch sensation across various parts of the body, from the arms, legs to the spinal cord and brain.
    <br><br>
    D. Translocation. If the chromosome breaks, it can reattach. Sometimes it reattaches to the wrong chromosome. In reciprocal translocation, segments from two different chromosomes are exchanged while in Robertsonian translocation, an entire chromosome attaches to another. Translocations generate novel chromosomes but are often linked to disorders like infertility and cancer. Several forms of cancer are caused by acquired translocations which has been described mainly in leukemia. Chromosomal translocation can also result to infertility in which one of the would-be parents carries a balanced translocation, where the parents are asymptomatic but conceived fetuses are not viable.
    <br><br>
    E. Inversion. When the fragment gets reattached, it gets reattached to the right chromosome but upside down. When this happens, it gives incorrect codes for information. In some cases, chromosomal inversion has been associated with congenital anomalies, growth retardation, infertility, recurrent pregnancy loss, and cancer.
    <br><br>
    Mitosis is a process where a single cell divides into two identical daughter cells (cell division). During mitosis one cell divides once to form two identical cells. The major purpose of mitosis is for growth and to replace worn out cells. If not corrected in time, mistakes made during mitosis can result in changes in the DNA that can potentially lead to genetic disorders.
    <br><br>
    Although errors in mitosis are rare, the process may go wrong especially during early cellular divisions in the zygote. Mitotic errors can be especially dangerous to the organism because future offspring from this parent cell will carry the same disorder such as the following:
    <br><br>
    Cancer. The Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA), sometimes called a genetic blueprint. contains the hereditary material in nearly all organisms. The improper copying of DNA produces two types of errors, or mutations. Silent mutations have no impact on the DNA sequence, but missense mutations, which alter amino acid sequences, often impact the associated function. Missense mutations can multiply over time, leading to cell cycle disruption and the formation of tumors, which are the product of runaway cell reproduction. Cancer occurs when mutated cells ignore or override the normal "checkpoints" regulating mitosis and begin to reproduce uncontrollably.
    <br><br>
    Hemophilia. It is a blood-clotting disorder which is linked to what geneticist refer to as Mosaicism, wherein some cells may have a mutant version of a gene while others have the normal version of the same gene.
    <br><br>
    Marfan syndrome. It is a genetic disorder that affects the body's connective tissue, Connective tissue holds all the body's cells, organs and tissue together. It also plays an important role in helping the body grow and develop properly. Connective tissue is made up of proteins. The protein that plays a role in Marfan syndrome is called fibrillin-1. Marfan syndrome is caused by a defect (or mutation) in the gene that tells the body how to make fibrillin-1. This mutation results in an increase in a protein called transforming growth factor beta, or TGF-B. The increase in TGF-
    <br><br>
    B causes problems in connective tissues throughout the body, which in turn creates the features and medical problems associated with Marfan syndrome and some related conditions. Because connective tissue is found throughout the body, Marfan syndrome can affect many different parts of the body, as well. Features of the disorder are most often found in the heart, blood vessels, bones, joints, and eyes. Some Marfan features for example, aortic enlargement (expansion of the main blood vessel that carries blood away from the heart to the rest of the body) can be life-threatening. The lungs, skin and nervous system may also be affected. Marfan syndrome does not affect intelligence.
