<p>LESSON 1:CELL THEORY</p>
<p class="color">The Theory of Spontenous Generation</p>
The Greek philosopher <strong>Aristotle</strong>(384-322 BC) was onr of the earliest recorded scholars to articulate the theory of spontaneous generation, the <strong>notion that life can arise from nonliving matter</strong>. Aristotle proposed that life arose from nonliving material if the material contained pneuma("vital heat"). As evidence, he noted several instances of the appearance of animals from environments previously devoid of such animals such as the seemingly sudden appearance of fish in a new puddle of water.
<br><br>
This theory persisted into the seventeenth century, when scientists undertook additional experimentation to support or disprove it. By this time, the proponents of the theory cited how frogs simply seem to appear along the muddy banks of the Nile River in Egypt during the annual flooding. Others observed that mice simply appeared among grain stored in barns with thatched roofs. When the roof leaked and the grain molded, mice appeared. <strong>Jan Baptista van Helmont</strong>, a seventeenth century Flemish scientist, proposed that mice could arise from rags and wheat kernels left in an open container for 3 weeks. In reality, such habitats provided ideal food sources and shelter for mouse populations to flourish.
<br><br>
However, one of van Helmont's contemporaries, Italian physician <strong>Francesco Redi (1626-1697)</strong>, performed an experiment in 1668 that was one of the first to refute the idea that maggots (the larvae of flies) spontancously generate on meat left out in the open air. He predicted that preventing flies from having direct contact with the meat would also prevent the appearance of maggots. Redi left meat in each of six containers (Figure1). Two were open to the air, two were covered with gauze, and two were tightly sealed. His hypothesis was supported when maggots developed in the uncovered jars, but no maggots appeared in either the gauze-covered or the tightly sealed jars. He concluded that maggots could only form when flies were allowed to lay eggs in the meat, and that the maggots were the offspring of flies, not the product of spontaneous generation.
In 1745, <strong>John Needham</strong> (1713-1781) published a report of his own experiments, in which he briefly boiled broth infused with plant or animal matter, hoping to kill all preexisting microbes. He then scaled the flasks. After a few days, Needham observed that the broth had become cloudy and a single drop contained numerous microscopic creatures. He argued that the new microbes must have arisen spontaneously. In reality, however, he likely did not boil the broth enough to kill all preexisting microbes.
<strong>Lazzaro Spallanzani</strong> (1729-1799) did not agree with Needham's conclusions, however, and performed hundreds of carefully executed experiments using heated broth. As in Neetham's experiment, broth in scaled jars and unscaled jars was infused with plant and animal matter. Spallanzani's results contradicted the findings of Needham: Heated but sealed flasks remained clear, without any signs of spontaneous growth, unless the flasks were subsequently opened to the air. This suggested that microbes were introduced into these flasks from the air. In response to Spallanzani's findings, Needham argued that life originates from a "life force" that was destroyed during Spallanzani's extended boiling. Any subsequent sealing of the flasks then prevented new life force from entering and causing spontaneous generation (Figure 2).
The debate over spontaneous generation continued well into the nineteenth century, with scientists serving as proponents of both sides. To settle the debate, the Paris Academy of Sciences offered a prize for resolution of the problem. Louis Pasteur, a prominent French chemist who had been studying microbial fermentation and the causes of wine spoilage, accepted the challenge. In 1858, Pasteur filtered air through a gun-cotton filter and, upon microscopic examination of the cotton, found it full of microorganisms, suggesting that the exposure of a broth to air was not introducing a "life force" to the broth but rather airborne microorganisms.
Later, Pasteur made a series of flasks with long, twisted necks ("swan-neck flasks), in which he boiled broth to sterilize it (Figure 3). His design allowed air inside the flasks to be exchanged with air from the outside, but prevented the introduction of any airborne microorganisms, which would get caught in the twists and bends of the flasks' necks. If a life force besides the airborne microorganisms were responsible for microbial growth within the sterilized flasks, it would have access to the broth, whereas the microorganisms would not. He correctly predicted that sterilized broth in his swan-neck flasks would remain sterile as long as the swan necks remained intact. However, should the necks be broken, microorganisms would be introduced, contaminating the flasks and allowing microbial growth within the broth.
Pasteur's set of experiments irrefutably disproved the theory of spontaneous generation and earned him the prestigious Alhumbert Prize from the Paris Academy of Sciences in 1862. In a subsequent lecture in 1864, Pasteur articulated "Omne vivum ex vivo" ("Life only comes from life"). In this lecture, Pasteur recounted his famous swan-neck flask experiment, stating that "life is a germ and a germ is life. Never will the doctrine of spontaneous generation recover from the mortal blow of this simple experiment.

<strong>Little is much: Understanding the Cork</strong>
<br><br>
The discovery of cells was made possible by the development of the microscope in the 17th century. In 1665, an English scientist,<strong>Robert Hooke</strong>, examined a thin slice of cork under the microscope. He observed that the piece of cork was composed of many tiny compartments which resembled little rooms with surrounding wall. Hooke named these compartments cells. The cells that Hooke observed were not living. He concentrated his study only on the structure, particularly on the cell investigation of the cell content.
In 1674, the Dutch inventor <strong>Antoine Van Leuwenhoek</strong> observed red blood cells, sperms and a myriad of single-celled organisms in pond water. He discovered free cells and observed the nucleus within some red blood cells. Leuwenhock was a contemporary of Robert Hooke. He had more success in living cells in action despite his smaller, simpler, handled microscopes.
Over the next 200 years after Hooke, another scientist, a Scottish botanist named <strong>Robert Brown</strong>, made a general conclusion in 1831. He discovered the nucleus and theorized that this structure is a fundamental and a constant component of the cell.
In 1835, a French biologist,<strong>Felix Dujardin</strong> found out that living cells contained an internal substance, Not knowing exactly what this substance was, Dujardin gave it the name sarcode. It was a Bohemian physiologist, Jan Evangelista Purkinje, who made a thorough investigation of this internal material. He gave it the name protoplasm, a term coined for the colloidal substance in the cell which is currently known as cytoplasm.
In 1838, <strong>Mathias Schleiden</strong>, a German botanist, stated that all plants are composed of cells. After him, in 1839, <strong>Theodore Schwann</strong>, a German zoologist, concluded that all animals are composed of cells. Jointly, Schleiden and Schwann came out with the theory that all living things are composed of cells. Twenty years later, in 1858, a German biologist, <strong>Rudolph Virchow</strong>, theorized that all living cells. come from pre-existing living cells. His conclusion arose from observing dividing cells while he was at work.

<p>LESSON 2:CELL STRUCTURE AND FUNCTIONS</p>

Roles to Rules; Structure to function
<br><br>
All of the life processes of a living cell involve transformation of energy and matter. The source of this life energy is the molecules undergoing chemical activities within the cell. A living cell performs the following life processes:
<br><br>
1. Nutrition is the process by which cells obtain food molecules to support their other activities.
<br><br>
2. Digestion is the process by which food particles are broken down into smaller soluble units suitable for cell use with the help of enzymes.
<br><br>
3. Absorption is the process by which cells absorb water, minerals and other materials essential to life from their environment,
<br><br>
4. Biosynthesis is the process by which all cells organize complex chemicals from simple building units or substances.
<br><br>
5. Excretion is the process by which by-products of all cell activities which are not needed for further cell functioning are eliminated.
<br><br>
6. Egestion is the process by which insoluble, non-digested particles. are eliminated by the cell.
<br><br>
7. Secretion is the process by which substances that are synthesized by the cells are expelled from the membrane. This elimination process helps in the functioning of the body,
<br><br>
8. Movement is a process which includes the locomotion of cell by means of special structures like cilia or flagella.
<br><br>
9. Irritability is the process by which cells respond or react to external factors or conditions around them. Cells can alter their functions in response to changes their environment.
<br><br>
10. Respiration is the process of breaking down food molecules into
chemical energy needed by all cells in order to function. 11. Reproduction is a process by which a cell copies or replicates its DNA and increases its number by cell division. It gives rise to new cells as a result, organisms grow.
<br><br>
The principal parts of a cell are:
<br><br>
1. Cell membrane
<br><br>
2. Cytoplasm
<br><br>
3. Nucleus
<br><br>
The nucleus is covered with a membrane that allows materials to pass in and out. It's often called the "control center" of the cell because it contains DNA. The nucleolus is where the ribosomes are formed and this structure can be found both in plants. and animals.
<br><br>
The cell membrane is a semi-permeable membrane that facilitate the movement of molecules inside and outside the plant or animal cell. It allows only chosen substances to enter or leave cell which can protect the cell from harmful substances.
<br><br>
The cell membrane is often pictured as fluid mosaic model. Fluidity becomes its characteristic because its molecules are constantly moving The phospholipid molecules move sideways within the membrane. Since the plasma membrane is fluid, it can seal itself if it is damaged or broken.
<br><br>
The cytoplasm is a viscous fluid or jelly like material where organelles are embedded. Its jelly like feature secures the organelles in plants and animals so that they remain place.]
<br><br>
The Mitochondria are called "powerhouses" the of cells. They produce much of the energy a plant or animal cell needs to carry out its functions. They are the centers of cellular respiration, a process in which energy-rich ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate) that functions in energy storage and transfer is produced.
<br><br>
A vacuole is the storage area of the cell. Vacuoles store water, food, and waste. Animals have a very small vacuole while plants as the producers through the process of photosynthesis. have a big central vacuole.
<br><br>
The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is series of tunnels throughout the cytoplasm.
<br><br>
They transport proteins from one part of the cell to another that is why they are called as the transport center of the cell.
<br><br>
E.R in plants and animals form a network of tiny canals through the cell. These canals are formed by two parallel membranes. They connect the nuclear membrane and the plasma membrane thus serving as passageway for food substances.
<br><br>
Two types of Endoplasmic Reticulum:
<br><br>
Smooth ribosome free and functions in detoxification of lipids.
<br><br>
Rough contains ribosomes and releases newly made protein from the cell..
<br><br>
Ribosomes are the protein factories_of the cell. These are very essential since all the functions and processes in plant and animal cell requires protein. Even all the organelles inside the cell are made up of proteins making ribosomes very important.
<br><br>
Golgi bodies receive proteins and other compounds from the ER. They package these materials. and distribute them to the plant and animal parts of the cell.
<br><br>
Lysosomes hydrolytic contain enzymes that can break things down. Lysosomes pick up bacteria, food, and old organelles in plant and animal cell and break them into small pieces that can be reused.
<br><br>
The cytoskeleton is a series of fibers made from proteins. It provides structure to the cell and gives it its shape.
<br><br>
Components of cytoskeleton
<br><br>
Microtubules absent in plant cell, it provide pathways for certain cellular molecules to move about just as tracks are provided for railroad cars or trains. It is also found in structures like the cilia and flagella which both aid in movement. For examples, the cells that line your windpipe use cilia to sweep foreign materials from the lungs. Sperm cells use flagella to move. It is also involve in cell division as a mitotic spindle.
<br><br>
Intermediate filaments these are absent in plants. Since they are the most stable component of the cytoskeleton, they are found in durable structures such as hair, scales and fingernails. They also help provide structure to the nuclear envelope.
<br><br>
Microfilaments pipe-like structures and help provide shape and movement for the cells. Examples of microfilaments are found in muscle cells.
<br><br>
Cell wall is a rigid organelle composed of cellulose that gives plant cell its box-like shape. The cell wall consist of several distinct layers. The primary cell wall is the outer layer, it expands as the cell grows. As the plant reaches its full size, a secondary cell wall develops inside the primary cell wall. This new layer adds strength to the wall. Two primary cell walls of adjacent cells are separated by another layer, the middle lamella which is composed of like Jelly polysaccharide called pectin. Both the primary and secondary walls are composed mainly of polysaccharide cellulose which is commercially important as the main component of paper and cotton. Aside for cellulose, the secondary walls usually contain lignin, a complex organic compound that adds hardness and rigidity to cell walls.
<br><br>
Plastids are double membrane bound organelles found in plants. It is basically the storage of their pigments. Types of Plastids include the Leucoplasts which are colorless organelles that store starch and Chromoplasts which contain colored pigments like chloroplast.
<br><br>
Centrioles are paired organelles found only in animal cell. They are located together near the nucleus, at right angles to each other. They are essential building cilia and flagella and also as spindle fiber during cell division.
<br><br>
<strong>School as an Analogy for Cell Structure and Function</strong>
<br><br>
The parts of the school are like the parts of the cell, keep reading and see how their functions are almost the samet
<br><br>
<li>Security guard- cell membrane because the guard chooses who can enter or leave the school, only those with student I.D can enter.</li>
<br><br>

<br><br>
<strong>The four basic types of Animal Tissue</strong>
<br><br>
<strong>Epithelial tissue</strong> is type of tissue made up of tightly packed cells. commonly seen outside the body as coverings or as linings of organs and cavities. Examples of epithelial tissue include the skin, the lining of the mouth and nose, and the lining of the digestive system.
<br><br>
<strong>Cells</strong> that make up epithelial tissues can have a distinct arrangement:
<br><br>
<strong>Cuboidal</strong>-The tissue is made of cube-shaped cells, it is for secretion.
<br><br>
<strong>Simple columnarbrick</strong>-shaped cell for secretion and active absorption.
<br><br>
<strong>Simple squamous</strong>-plate-like cells for exchange of material through diffusion
<br><br>
Stratified squamous-multilayered and regenerates quickly; for protection
<br><br>
<strong>Pseudo-stratified columnar</strong>- single layer cells; may just look stacked because of varying height; for lining of respiratory tract; usually lined with cilia.
<br><br>
<strong>Connective tissues</strong> are made up of fibrous cells. Blood and bone are examples of specialized connective tissues. The cells of the connective tissue are separate by nonliving material called extracellular matrix. These tissues help hold other tissues together like during the formation of organs and have the ability to stretch and contract positively.
<br><br>
<strong>Blood</strong> is made up of plasma (le., liquid extracellular matrix) that contains water, salts, and dissolved proteins; erythrocytes that carry oxygen (RBC), leukocytes for defense (WBC), and platelets for blood clotting. It is the only fluid connective tissue..
<br><br>
<strong>Connective tissue</strong> proper (CTP) is made up of loose connective tissue that is made up of collagenous fibers found in tendons and ligaments (holds bones together and keeps them in place). Adipose tissues are examples of loose connective tissues that store fats which functions to insulate the body and store energy.
<br><br>
<strong>Cartilage</strong> is characterized by collagenous fibers embedded in chondroitin sulfate. Chondrocytes are the cells that secrete collagen and chondroitin sulfate. Cartilage functions as cushion between bones. They are present at the tips of external ears, bronchi, vertebral column, etc.
<br><br>
<strong>Bone</strong> is a mineralized connective tissue made by bone-forming cells called osteoblasts which deposit collagen. It is a hard-connective tissue which forms the framework of the body. The matrix of collagen is combined with calcium, magnesium, and phosphate tons to make the bone hard. Blood vessels and nerves are found at a central canal surrounded by concentric circles of osteons.
<br><br>
<strong>Muscle tissues</strong> are tissues composed of long cells called muscle fibers that allow the body to move voluntary or involuntary. Movement of muscles is a response to signals coming from nerve cells. In vertebrates, these muscles can be categorized into the following:
<br><br>
<strong>Skeletal</strong> -striated in appearance; voluntary movements
<br><br>
<strong>Cardiac</strong> striated with intercalated disk for synchronized heart contraction; involuntary
<br><br>
<strong>Smooth</strong>-not striated muscle with tampered ends; involuntary
<br><br>
<strong>Nervous tissues</strong> are composed of nerve cells called neurons and glial cells. that function as support cells. These neurons sense stimuli and transmit electrical signals throughout the animal body. Neurons connect to other neurons to send signals. The dendrite is the part of the neuron that receives impulses from other neurons while the axon is the part where the impulse is transmitted to other neurons.

<P>LESSON 3:PROKARYOTIC VS. EUKARYOTIC </P>
Comparing Prokaryotic Cell and Eukaryotic Cell
<br><br>
Cells fall into one of two broad categories: prokaryotic and eukaryotic. The predominantly single-celled organisms of the domains Bacteria and Archaea are classified as prokaryotes (pro- before, karyon nucleus). Animal cells, plant cells, fungi, and protists are eukaryotes (eu- true).
<br><br>
Components of Prokaryotic Cell
<br><br>
All cells share four common components:
<br><br>
1 A plasma membrane, an outer covering that separates the cell's interior from its surrounding environment.
<br><br>
2 Cytoplasm, consisting of a jelly-like region within the cell in which other cellular components are found.
<br><br>
3 DNA, the genetic material of the cell; and
<br><br>
4 ribosomes, particles that synthesize proteins. However, prokaryotes differ from eukaryotic cells in several ways.
<br><br>
A prokaryotic cell is a simple, single-celled (unicellular) organism that lacks a nucleus, or any other membrane-bound organelle. We will shortly come to see that this is significantly different in eukaryotes. Prokaryotic DNA is found in the central part of the cell: a darkened region called the nucleoid. (Figure 1).
<br><br>
Unlike Archaea and eukaryotes, bacteria have a cell wall made of peptidoglycan, comprised of sugars and amino acids, and many have a polysaccharide capsule (Figure 1). The cell wall acts as an extra layer of protection, helps the cell maintain its shape, and prevents dehydration. The capsule enables the cell to attach to surfaces in its environment. Some prokaryotes have flagella, pili, or fimbriae. Flagella are used for locomotion. Pili are used to exchange genetic material during a type of reproduction called conjugation. Fimbriae are protein appendages used by bacteria to attach to other cells.
<br><br>
Components of Eukaryotic Cell
<br><br>
What are the key features of eukaryotic cells? Unlike prokaryotic cells, eukaryotic cells have:
<br><br>
1. A membrane-bound nucleus, a central cavity surrounded by membrane that houses the cell's genetic material.
<br><br>
2. A number of membrane-bound organelles, compartments with specialized functions that float in the cytosol. (Organelle means "little organ," and this name reflects that the organelles, like the organs of our body, have unique functions as part of a larger system.)
<br><br>
3. Multiple linear chromosomes, as opposed to the single circular chromosome of a prokaryote. 
<br><br>
Eukaryotic cells are much more complicated than those of prokaryotes. They are packed with a fascinating array of subcellular structures that play important roles in energy balance, metabolism, and gene expression.
<br><br>
A eukaryote is an organism made up of one or more eukaryotic cells. All multicellular organisms are made of eukaryotic cells. The DNA of a eukaryotic cell is found in an internal compartment of the cell called the nucleus. All eukaryotic cells have membrane-bound organelles. An organelle is a small structure found in the cytoplasm that carries out specific activities inside the cell. Each organelle in a eukaryotic cell performs distinct functions. The complex organization of eukaryotic cells. enables them to carry out more specialized functions than prokaryotic cells.
<br><br>

<P>LESSON 4:CELL TYPES</P>
Sperm Cell
<br><br>
Sperm cells are produced in the testes. The sperm cell is small and streamlined, allowing it to move easily and has a flagellum (a whip-like tail) that propels it. The function of these celis is to fertilize eggs cells during reproduction, Sperm cells contain half the number of chromosomes as the other in the body.
<br><br>
Root Hair Cell
<br><br>
Root hair cells are found in the roots of plants and absorb water for the plant more efficiently. Water is a reactant used in photosynthesis; the chemical reaction plants use to make their own food.
<br><br>
Microvilli
<br><br>
Microvilli, in the most simplistic terms, are tiny little microscopic projections that exist in, on, and around cells. They can exist on their own or in conjunction with villi (projections of same mucous membranes, most specifically of the small intestine, which are tiny folds that project out like numerous fingers). It may sweep unwanted materials toward a resorptive area of the cell. They are also involved in a wide variety of other functions, which include absorption, secretion, cellular adhesion, and mechanotransduction.
<br><br>
Cilia and Flagella
<br><br>
Cilia and flagella are fine, whiplike/hairlike structures that extend from the body of a variety of cells. While they vary in terms of length and numbers in different types of cells (as well as patterns of movement), cilia and flagella are generally identical in structure and composition. Cilia can e used for filtering air (in the trachea, for example) or for movement while flagella are used for movement
<br><br>
Nerve Cells
<br><br>
Mostly elongated, facilitate the transmission of impulses from the brain and the spinal cord to the different roots of the body.
