<P>LESSON 6:PHASES OF THE CELL CYCLE</P>
The cell cycle can be thought of as the life cycle of a cell in other words, it is the series of growth and development steps a cell undergoes bet ween its "birth"-formation by the division of a mother cell reproduction division to make two new daughter cells.
<br><br>
Stages of the cell cycle
<br><br>
To divide, a cell must complete several important tasks: it must grow. copy its genetic material (DNA), and physically split into two daughter cells. Cella perform these tasks in an organized, predictable series of steps that make up the cell cycle. The cell cycle is a cycle, rather than a linear pathway, because at the end of each go-round, the two daughter cells can start the exact same process over again from the beginning.
<br><br>
In eukaryotic cells, or cells with a nucleus, the stages of the cell cycle interphase and the mitotic (M) phase are divided into two major phases:

<li>During interphase the cell grows and makes a copy of its DNA.</li>

<li>During the mitotic (M) phase the cell separates its DNA into two sets and divides its cytoplasm, forming two new cells.</li>

Interphase
<br><br>
Let's enter the cell cycle just as a cell forms, by division of its mother cell. What must this newborn cell do next if it wants to go on and divide itself? Preparation for division happens in three steps:

<li>G1 phase. During G1 phase, also called the first gap phase, the cell grows physically larger, copies organelles, and makes the molecular building blocles it will need in later steps.</li>

<li>S phase. In 5 phase, the cell synthesizes a complete copy of the DNA in its nucleus. It also duplicates a microtubule organizing structure called the centresome. The centrosomes help separate DNA during M phase.</li>

<li>G2 phase. During the second gap phase, or G2 phase, the cell grows more, makes proteins and organelles, and begins to reorganize its contents in preparation for mitosis, G2 phase ends when mitnsis hegins.</li>

The G1, S, and G2 phases together are known as interphase. The prefix inter-means between, reflecting that interphase takes place between one mitotic (M) phase and the next.
<br><br>
M phase
<br><br>
During the mitotic (M) phase, the cell divides its copied DNA and cytoplasm to make two new cells. M phase involves two distinct division-related processes: mitosis and cytokinesis.
<br><br>
In mitosis, the nuclear DNA of the cell condenses into visible chromosomes and is pulled apart by the mitotic spindle, a specialized structure made out of microtubules. Mitosis takes place in four stages: prophase (sometimes divided into early prophase and prometaphase), metaphase, anaphase, and telophase.
<br><br>
In cytokinesis, the cytoplasm of the cell is split in two, making two new cells. Cytokinesis usually begins just as mitosis is ending, with a little overlap. Importantly, cytokinesis takes place differently in animal and plant cells.
<br><br>
In animals, cell division occurs when a band of cytoskeletal fibres called the contractile ring contracts inward and pinches the cell in two, a process called contractile cytokinesis. The indentation produced as the ring contracts inward is called the cleavage furrow. Animal cells can be pinched in two because they're relatively soft and squishy.
<br><br>
<li>Plant cells are much stiffer than animal cells; they're surrounded by a rigid cell wall and have high internal pressure. Because of this, plant cells divide in two by building a new structure down the middle of the cell. This structure, known as the cell plate, is made up of plasma membrane and cell wall components delivered in vesicles, and it partitions the cell in two.</li>
<br><br>
GO Phase
<br><br>
While some cells are constantly dividing, some cell types are at rest. These cells may exit G1 and enter a resting state called GO. In GO, a cell is performing its function without actively preparing to divide. GO is a permanent state for some cells, while others may re-start division if they get the right signals.
<br><br>
<strong>Cell cycle checkpoints</strong>

A checkpoint is a stage in the eukaryotic cell cycle at which the cell examines internal and external cues and "decides" whether or not to move forward with division.
<br><br>
There are a number of checkpoints, but the three most important ones are:
<br><br>
<li>The G1 checkpoint, at the G1/S transition.</li>

<li>The G2 checkpoint, at the G2/M transition.</li>

<li>The spindle checkpoint, at the transition from metaphase to anaphase</li>

The G1 checkpoint
<br><br>
The G1 checkpoint is the main decision point for a cell primary point at which it must choose whether or not to divide. Once the cell passes the G1 checkpoint and enters S phase, it becomes irreversibly committed to division. That is, barring unexpected problems, such as DNA damage or replication errors, a cell that passes the G1 checkpoint will continue the rest of the way through the cell cycle and produce two daughter cells.
<br><br>
At the G1 checkpoint, a cell checks whether internal and external conditions are right for division. Here are some of the factors a cell might assess:
<br><br>
<li>Size. Is the cell large enough to divide?</li>
Nutrients. Does the cell have enough energy reserves or available nutrients to divide?
<br><br>
Molecular signals. Is the cell receiving positive cues (such as growth factors) from neighbors?
<br><br>
DNA integrity. Is any of the DNA damaged?
<br><br>
These are not the only factors that can affect progression through the G1 checkpoint, and which factors are most important depend on the type of cell. For instance, some cells also need mechanical cues (such as being attached to a supportive network called the extracellular matrix) in order to divide.
<br><br>
If a cell doesn't get the go-ahead cues it needs at the G1 checkpoint, it may leave the cell cycle and enter a resting state called GO phase. Some cells stay permanently in GO, while others resume dividing if conditions improve.
<br><br>
The G2 checkpoint
<br><br>
DNA replication. Was the DNA completely copied during S phase?
<br><br>
If errors or damage are detected, the cell will pause at the G2 checkpoint to allow for repairs. If the checkpoint mechanisms detect problems with the DNA, the cell cycle is halted, and the cell attempts to either complete DNA replication or repair the damaged DNA.
<br><br>
If the damage is irreparable, the cell may undergo apoptosis, or programmed cell death. This self-destruction mechanism ensures that damaged DNA is not passed on to daughter cells and is important in preventing cancer.
<br><br>
<strong>The spindle checkpoint</strong>
<br><br>
The M checkpoint is also known as the spindle checkpoint: here, the cell examines whether all the sister chromatids are correctly attached to the spindle microtubules. Because the separation of the sister chromatids during anaphase is an irreversible step, the cycle will not proceed until all the chromosomes are firmly attached to at least two spindle fibers from opposite poles of the cell.
<br><br>
How does this checkpoint work? It seems that cells don't actually scan the metaphase plate to confirm that all of the chromosomes are there. Instead, they look for "straggler" chromosomes that are in the wrong place (e.g.. floating around in the cytoplasm). If a chromosome is misplaced, the cell will pause mitosis, allowing time for the spindle to capture the stray chromosome.
<br><br>
Regulation
<br><br>
The progression of cells through the cell cycle is controlled by checkpoints at different stages. These detect if cell contains damaged DNA and ensure those cells do not replicate. The Restriction point (R) is located at G1 and is a key checkpoint. The vast majority of cells that pass through the R point will end up completing the entire cell cycle. Other checkpoints are located at the transitions between Gl and S, and G2 and M.
<br><br>
If damaged DNA is detected at any checkpoint, activation of the checkpoint results in increased protein p53 production. p53 is a tumor suppressor gene that stops the progression of the cell cycle and starts repair mechanisms for the damaged DNA. If this DNA cannot be repaired, then it ensures the cell undergoes apoptosis and can no longer replicate.
<br><br>
This cell cycle is also closely regulated by cyclins which control cell progression by activating cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) enzymes.
<br><br>
An example of a tumor suppressor protein would be retinoblastoma protein (Rb). Rb restricts the ability of a cell to progress from G1 to S phase in the cell cycle. CDK phosphorylates Rb to pRb, making it unable to restrict cell proliferation. This allows cells to divide normally in the cell cycle.
