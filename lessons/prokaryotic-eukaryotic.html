    <h2>LESSON 3:PROKARYOTIC VS. EUKARYOTIC </h2>

    Comparing Prokaryotic Cell and Eukaryotic Cell
    <br><br>
    Cells fall into one of two broad categories: prokaryotic and eukaryotic. The predominantly single-celled organisms of the domains Bacteria and Archaea are classified as prokaryotes (pro- before, karyon nucleus). Animal cells, plant cells, fungi, and protists are eukaryotes (eu- true).
    <br><br>
    Components of Prokaryotic Cell
    <br><br>
    All cells share four common components:
    <br><br>
    1 A plasma membrane, an outer covering that separates the cell's interior from its surrounding environment.
    <br><br>
    2 Cytoplasm, consisting of a jelly-like region within the cell in which other cellular components are found.
    <br><br>
    3 DNA, the genetic material of the cell; and
    <br><br>
    4 ribosomes, particles that synthesize proteins. However, prokaryotes differ from eukaryotic cells in several ways.
    <br><br>
    A prokaryotic cell is a simple, single-celled (unicellular) organism that lacks a nucleus, or any other membrane-bound organelle. We will shortly come to see that this is significantly different in eukaryotes. Prokaryotic DNA is found in the central part of the cell: a darkened region called the nucleoid. (Figure 1).
    <br><br>
    Unlike Archaea and eukaryotes, bacteria have a cell wall made of peptidoglycan, comprised of sugars and amino acids, and many have a polysaccharide capsule (Figure 1). The cell wall acts as an extra layer of protection, helps the cell maintain its shape, and prevents dehydration. The capsule enables the cell to attach to surfaces in its environment. Some prokaryotes have flagella, pili, or fimbriae. Flagella are used for locomotion. Pili are used to exchange genetic material during a type of reproduction called conjugation. Fimbriae are protein appendages used by bacteria to attach to other cells.
    <br><br>
    Components of Eukaryotic Cell
    <br><br>
    What are the key features of eukaryotic cells? Unlike prokaryotic cells, eukaryotic cells have:
    <br><br>
    1. A membrane-bound nucleus, a central cavity surrounded by membrane that houses the cell's genetic material.
    <br><br>
    2. A number of membrane-bound organelles, compartments with specialized functions that float in the cytosol. (Organelle means "little organ," and this name reflects that the organelles, like the organs of our body, have unique functions as part of a larger system.)
    <br><br>
    3. Multiple linear chromosomes, as opposed to the single circular chromosome of a prokaryote. 
    <br><br>
    Eukaryotic cells are much more complicated than those of prokaryotes. They are packed with a fascinating array of subcellular structures that play important roles in energy balance, metabolism, and gene expression.
    <br><br>
    A eukaryote is an organism made up of one or more eukaryotic cells. All multicellular organisms are made of eukaryotic cells. The DNA of a eukaryotic cell is found in an internal compartment of the cell called the nucleus. All eukaryotic cells have membrane-bound organelles. An organelle is a small structure found in the cytoplasm that carries out specific activities inside the cell. Each organelle in a eukaryotic cell performs distinct functions. The complex organization of eukaryotic cells. enables them to carry out more specialized functions than prokaryotic cells.
