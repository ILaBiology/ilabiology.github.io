<p>LESSON 11:STRUCTURE AND COMPOSITION OF CELL MEMBRANE</p>
Active transport-movement of molecules from region with low concentration to a region with higher concentration, or against the concentration gradient. Requires energy.
<br><br>
Amphipathic compound containing both the hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions.
<br><br>
Carbohydrates -biomacromolecules containing Carbon, Oxygen, and Hydrogen.
<br><br>
Cell Membrane-biological membrane that separates the interior of the cell from the environment.
<br><br>
Fluidity-quality of flowing.
<br><br>
Glycolipids-molecules of carbohydrates covalently bonded to lipids.
<br><br>
Glycoproteins molecules of carbohydrates covalently bonded to proteins
<br><br>
Hydrophilic-molecules/compounds that are attracted to water.
<br><br>
Hydrophobic-molecules/compounds that repel water.
<br><br>
Lipids-biomacromolecules containing hydrocarbons, ex. wax, oil, fats
<br><br>
Macromolecule a molecule containing a large number of atom.
<br><br>
For teaching purposes only.
<br><br>
Passive transport-movement of molecules from region with high concentration to a region with lower concentration, or or along along the the concer concentration gradient. Does not require energy.
<br><br>
Phospholipid bilayer polar membrane made of two lipid molecules.
<br><br>
Protein a type of biomacromolecule, composed of amino acids.
<br><br>
Rigidity-quality of resisting bending/changing.
<br><br>
Semi-permeability property of the membrane that allow selective entry and/or exit of materials into/from the cell.
<br><br>
The plasma membrane is the edge of life, the boundary that separates the living cell from its surroundings and controls traffic into and out of the cell it surrounds. Like all biological membranes, the plasma membrane exhibits selective permeability; that is, it allows some substances to cross it more easily than others. The ability of the cell to discriminate in its chemical exchanges with its environment is fundamental to life, and it is the plasma membrane and its component molecules that make this selectivity possible.
<br><br>
The cell membrane possesses some effectively. These properties include (1) fluidity, (2) semi-permeability, and (3) rigidity. Fluidity and rigidity play their function for keeping the cell membrane intact, thus protecting the organelles inside while keeping out potential toxic materials. Being semi-permeable allows the cell membrane to study.com selectively allow entry and exit of materials through. Therefore, the two main function of the cell membrane are: (1) for protection and (2) for transport of materials in and out of the cell. Also, because of phospholipid bilayer's amphipathic molecular structure (hydrophobic tail and hydrophilic head), the cell membrane is stable.
<br><br>
Transport of molecules in and out of the cell is affected by the concentration gradient and the type of molecules that is to be transported. There are molecules that can easily enter and exit the cell membrane without the use of energy (passive), whereas there are those that ultimately requires the use of energy (ATP) to proceed. Concentration gradient easily affects the process, molecules move passively from regions with higher concentration, while they move actively (uses energy in the form of ATP) when moving from regions with low concentration towards a region with higher concentration
